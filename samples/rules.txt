Counts as equivalent:
    - Having to break conventions of builtins or the standard library in order to kill the mutant.
        - Replacing builtin functions to change their behavior in unexpected ways.
        - Creating unexpected objects (e.g. objects without a "__class__" attribute).
        - Creating subclasses of standard types (e.g. list, str) that change their behavior in unexpected ways.
    - Having to change the environment in order to kill the mutant. (e.g. changing to a different OS or Python interpreter)

Counts as killable:
    - Having to check SyntaxWarning on import.
    - Having to replace/mock package-internal symbols.
    - Having to pass sub-classes of standard types (e.g. a UserString subclass instead of str).
    - Having to create a class that is "==" to a builtin class.
    - Having to create an object that is "==" to some other object.
    - Having to count method invocations (even on subtypes of standard types) to kill the mutant.
    - Having to mock sys.version_info or the OS name.

Equivalence status is determined for "cpython-3.8.19-linux-x86_64-gnu" on Linux.
