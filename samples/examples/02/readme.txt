The mutant turns an "==" comparison, where the left side is a value returned by "len", into a "<=" comparison. The length of a list can not be less than 0, which should make the comparisons equal. One could define custom list class, extending Python's "UserList", that returns a length less than 0, but this is caught by the "len" function. Therefore we replace the builtin "len" function.
