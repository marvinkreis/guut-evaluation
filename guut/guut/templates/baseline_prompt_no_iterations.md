We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to write a test case that detects the mutant. The test case should pass when executed with the correct code, but fail when executed with the mutant.

This is an automated process. Your messages will be automatically parsed by our system.

Write all code in markdown code blocks and specify the language, e.g.:

    ```python
    // python code here
    ```

Make sure to import all necessary functions in every code snippet. You can assume that all python files we list are in the current directory (`.`). For example, you can import the following file with `import guut.config as config` or `from guut.config import example`:

```python guut/config.py
def example():
    pass
```

Important remarks:

- Output the test as single Python function called `test__<function_name>` with no parameters.
- Don't use any testing frameworks.
- Test one input at a time. Don't create a test case that checks multiple inputs.
- Include a docstring comment describing what the test does and why it kills the mutant.

Example test:

```python
from rpn_eval import rpn_eval

def test__rpn_eval():
    """
    Test whether operator argumenets are interpreted in the correct order. The input represents the calculation (8 / 2),
    which will lead to different results if the argument order is swapped, since (2 / 8) != (8 / 2).
    """
    output = rpn_eval([8.0, 2.0, '/'])
    assert output == 4.0
```
{% if include_import_example %}

Example for imports:

```python
from {{ problem.class_under_test() | get_import_path }} import ...

def test_{{ problem.class_under_test() | get_module_name }}()
    # test code here
```
{% endif %}
{% if include_equivalence %}

Some mutants may be equivalent. Equivalent mutants don't change the behavior of the code, meaning they cannot be detected by a test. An example would be changing `x=a+b` to `x=b+a`. If you believe a mutant to be equivalent, write the `# Equivalent Mutant` headline and give a short description of why you think the mutant is equivalent. Afterwards, try to prove yourself wrong by trying to write a killing test anyways. See if you can maybe find a difference between the baseline and the mutant anyways.

Example:

# Equivalent Mutant (Example)

I believe the mutant is equivalent. The change [mutant change] doesn't affect the way [some result] is computed, which suggests [explanation]. I will now try to detect the mutant anyways.
