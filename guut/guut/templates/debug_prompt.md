We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to use scientific debugging to gain an understanding of the mutant, and then write a test case that kills the mutant.

This is an automated process, consisting of a loop of "hypothesis", "experiment" and "conclusion" until you are ready to write a "test" or to declare the mutant "equivalent". During this loop, you will submit "experiment" code and "test" code, which our system is going to parse and then execute for you. Since your messages will be automatically parsed, pay close attention to the format we expect of your messages. This includes the markdown headlines (e.g., "# Experiment"). Do not write any markdown headlines other than the ones described below.


# Output Format

The process will use the following format:

    # Task
    (we will provide the code under test and the mutant)

    # Debugging

    ## Hypothesis
    (your hypothesis)

    ## Experiment
    (your experiment code and prediction)

    ### Experiment Results
    #### Running Experiment on Baseline
    (we will write the baseline results)
    #### Running Experiment on Mutant
    (we will write the mutant results)

    ## Conclusion
    (your conclusion)

    [repeat ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until you found inputs that can detect the mutant]

    ## Test
    (your mutant-killing test)

    ### Test Results
    #### Running Test on Baseline
    (we will give the results)
    #### Running Test on Mutant
    (we will give the results)

    [repeat ("Test") or ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until a test successfully kills the mutant]

    [at any point, if you believe the mutant to be equivalent to the original code]
    ## Equivalent Mutant
    (a short explanation about why the mutant is equivalent)

## Notes

Make sure that `## Experiment` is always followed by `### Experiment Results` and `## Test` is always followed by `## Test Results`. This is important for parsing your responses.


# Output Format for Code

Write all code in markdown code blocks and specify the language, e.g.,

    ```python
    // python code here
    ```

Make sure to import all necessary functions in every code snippet. You can assume that all python files we list are in the current directory (`.`). For example, you can import the following file with `import guut.config as config` or `from guut.config import example`:

```python guut/config.py
def example():
    pass
```

Output all code in single Python function called `test__<function_name>` with no parameters. Don't use any testing frameworks. Don't call the test function yourself.


# Running code

Whenever you submit a test case (experiment or test), our system will run your code on the **Baseline** (the correct code, without the mutant) and give you the output. When that is finished, it applies the **Mutant** to the code and runs your code again.

This means that your test case can only use one version of the target code (**Baseline** or **Mutant**) at once. Your test case simply imports the target code and runs it, without knowing if it imported the **Baseline** or the **Mutant**. Since the system will run your test case once with the **Baseline** and once with the **Mutant**, you will still get the output for both versions.

Again, you cannot import the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** together. Your tests will import the target code, which can be either the **Baseline** or the **Mutant**. It is your job to design the test in a way, such that it produces different outputs when we switch out the imported target code from the **Baseline** to the **Mutant**.

Therefore, there is no point in re-implementing the code yourself, since the test should examine the imported code, not a recreation of it. Recreating the target code will make your test case useless.

We also do not provide a `mutant` module, so imports like `from mutant.sieve import sieve` will result in `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mutant'`. This makes the test case useless.

Our system also cannot respond to instructive comments like `# Please run this with the mutant:`. The system executes *your entire experiment/test* with the **Baseline**, then executes *your entire experiment/test* with the **Mutant**. Leaving instructions in comments won't change this, and will instead make your test case useless.

Your code will be executed with a timeout of 5 seconds. If this time is exceeded, the execution will be stopped and we will inform you about the timeout.

# Scientific Debugging

Scientific debugging is a systematic debugging approach based on the scientific method. The process follows a loop of:

- Hypothesis
- Experiment
- Conclusion

## Hypotheses

Each hypothesis should describe an assumption you have about the code. Hypotheses are the key aspect of scientific debugging, and should be written detailed and with great care.

- Base hypotheses on the findings of previous experiments.
- Don't repeat hypotheses you have already made.
- Don't base hypotheses on untested assumptions.

Predict exactly what will happen. Avoid broad predictions like "Under any of the given inputs, the mutant will behave differently". Instead, write predictions like "The input [input] will satisfy [conditions]."

Hypotheses loosely follow this template: Given [observations], I hypothesize that [assumption] holds when [given inputs]. I predict that [assumed result] and I will verify this by [more explanation and experiment description].

## Experiments

After stating a hypothesis, you create an experiment to test it. Each experiment will contain a Python test case, which imports and calls the target code. Once you stated the test case, our system will add it to the target code and execute it. First, it runs your code on the **Baseline** (the correct code, without the mutant) and gives you the output. When that is finished, it applies the **Mutant** to the code and runs your code again, also giving you the output.

Each experiment should contain a relevant prediction based on your hypothesis and a way to verify that prediction based on the output. Basically, you run the target code and predict the output based on your hypothesis. Therefore, add print statements to print out relevant values, which will help you understand what the code is doing.

Your experiment is agnostic of which version of the code it is handling (**Baseline** or **Mutant**). Therefore, never use add print statements like `print(f"baseline output: {output}")` or `print(f"mutant output: {output}")`. This will make your experiment results confusing and useless. Instead, use print statements that make sense with both versions like `print(f"output: {output}")`.

Some notes:
- Keep your experiments/tests short and simple.
- Use print statements liberally in your experiments.
- Never recreate the mutant as part of your experiment/test.
- Check one input at a time.

Here is an example experiment for a `is_valid_parenthesization` function. See how it prints the output, then checks if the output matches the prediction.

### Example Experiment

```python
from is_valid_parenthesization import is_valid_parenthesization

def test__is_valid_parenthesization():
    """
    Check if the target function correctly handles missing closing parentheses.
    """
    output = is_valid_parenthesization('(()')
    assert output == False
```

#### Running Experiment on Baseline

```

```

#### Running Experiment on Mutant

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
    test__is_valid_parenthesization()
  File "test.py", line 8, in test__is_valid_parenthesization
    assert output == False
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```
The experiment exited with exit code 1.

## Conclusions

After every experiment, write a conclusion that summarizes on the results. Summarize your conclusion in a short list, so you can refer back to them easily.

Pay close attention to experiment output:
- Did the baseline have any errors? Does the experiment need to be fixed?
- Are there any discrepancies between the output of the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**? That means you detected mutant.

It is already enough to find a single input that can distinguish between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**. Any difference in output counts, as well as any difference in exceptions or timeouts. Any difference in behavior. Once you have found an input that triggers a difference, you can continue and write the test case that fails when it observes the **Mutant** behavior.

Otherwise, keep creating hypotheses and experiments until you have found the right inputs. Then you can finish debugging and write the mutant-killing test.

## Tests

Once you have found any inputs that cause a difference in behavior, you can write a test that kills the mutant. Similarly to experiments, when you finished writing your code, we will copy the test case and execute it against the **Baseline**, i.e., the regular program without the mutant, then apply the **Mutant** and execute it again.

The test kills the mutant if, and only if, the test passes when executed with the **Baseline** and fails when executed with the **Mutant**. Here, failing is defined as exiting with exit code 1. This means that the test needs to result in either a *failed assertion*, an *uncaught exception* or a *timeout* when executed on the **Mutant**.

This means that you have to include relevant assertions in your test, unless the mutant raises an exception or results in a timeout. If the mutant raises an exception or error, do not use a `try-except` block to catch it. Adding a `try-except` block that handles the exception means that the exception will not make the test case fail.

Include a relevant docstring comment with a summary of your findings. The comment should explain what the test checks for and why. Include relevant findings from your conclusions. The comment should be understandable even without the context of this conversation.

Here is an example test for a `rpn_eval` function that evaluates expressions in Reverse Polish notation:

### Example Test

```python
from rpn_eval import rpn_eval

def test__rpn_eval():
    """
    Test whether operator arguments are interpreted in the correct order. The input represents the calculation (8 / 2),
    which will lead to different results if the argument order is swapped, since (2 / 8) != (8 / 2).
    """
    output = rpn_eval([8.0, 2.0, '/'])
    assert output == 4.0
```

#### Example Test Results

##### Running Test on Baseline
```

```

##### Running Test on Mutant
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
    test__rpn_eval()
  File "test.py", line 8, in test__rpn_eval
    assert output == 4.0
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```
The test exited with exit code 1.

## Equivalent Mutants

Some mutants may be equivalent. Equivalent mutants don't change the behavior of the code, meaning they cannot be detected by a test. An example would be changing `x=a+b` to `x=b+a`. If you believe a mutant to be equivalent, write the `## Equivalent Mutant` headline and give a short description of why you think the mutant is equivalent. Include some information from your experiments to back up your claims. Afterwards, try to prove yourself wrong by doing more experiments. See if you can maybe find a difference between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** anyways.

Example:

I believe the mutant is equivalent. The change [mutant change] doesn't affect the way the target code computes [some result]. My previous tests show that [tried inputs] did not result in any different behavior in the mutant, which suggest [more explanation]. I will now try to detect the mutant anyways. Since my past tries have failed to detect the mutant, I will now try [new approach].

## Strategy

The first goal is always to cover the mutant, meaning to execute the part of the code it changes. Take a look at the target code and check which conditions your experiment/test needs to meet in order to execute the mutant (for example, passing parameters that meet certain if conditions), then create an experiment that meets those conditions.

Keep your experiments and tests short, so they don't fail because of accidental mistakes in your code. Try only one or two inputs at a time. Shorter experiments are also easier to understand and reason about.
