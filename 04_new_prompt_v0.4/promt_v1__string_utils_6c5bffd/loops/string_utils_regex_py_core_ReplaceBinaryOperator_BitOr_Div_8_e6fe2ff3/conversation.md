You are a helpful AI coding assistant, who is proficient in python coding and debugging.


We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to use scientific debugging to gain an understanding of the mutant, and then write a test case that kills the mutant.

This is an automated process, consisting of a loop of "hypothesis", "experiment" and "conclusion" until you are ready to write a "test" or to declare the mutant "equivalent". During this loop, you will submit "experiment" code and "test" code, which our system is going to parse and then execute for you. Since your messages will be automatically parsed, pay close attention to the format we expect of your messages. This includes the markdown headlines (e.g., "# Experiment"). Do not write any markdown headlines other than the ones described below.


# Output Format

The process will use the following format:

    # Task
    (we will provide the code under test and the mutant)

    # Debugging

    ## Hypothesis
    (your hypothesis)

    ## Experiment
    (your experiment code and prediction)

    ### Experiment Results
    #### Running Experiment on Baseline
    (we will write the results)
    #### Running Experiment on Mutant
    (we will write the results)

    ## Conclusion
    (your conclusion)

    [repeat ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until you found inputs that can detect the mutant]

    ## Test
    (your mutant-killing test)

    ### Test Results
    #### Running Test on Baseline
    (we will give the results)
    #### Running Test on Mutant
    (we will give the results)

    [repeat ("Test") or ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until a test successfully killed the mutant]

    [at any point, if you believe the mutant to be equivalent to the original code]
    ## Equivalent Mutant
    (a short explanation about why the mutant is equivalent)

## Notes

Make sure that `## Experiment` is always followed by `### Experiment Results` and `## Test` is always followed by `## Test Results`. This is important for parsing your responses.


# Output Format for Code

Write all code in markdown code blocks and specify the language, e.g.:

    ```python
    // python code here
    ```

Make sure to import all necessary functions in every code snippet. You can assume that all python files we list are in the current directory (`.`). For example, you can import the following file with `import guut.config as config` or `from guut.config import example`:

```python guut/config.py
def example():
    pass
```

Output all code in single Python function called `test__<function_name>` with no parameters. Don't use any testing frameworks.


# Running code

Whenever you submit a test case (experiment or test), our system will run your code on the **Baseline** (the correct code, without the mutant) and give you the output. When that is finished, it applies the **Mutant** to the code and runs your code again.

This means that your test case can only use one version of the target code (**Baseline** or **Mutant**) at once. You test case simply imports the target code and runs it, without knowing if it imported the **Baseline** or the **Mutant**. Since the system will run your test case once with the **Baseline** and once with the **Mutant**, you will still get the output for both versions.

Again, you cannot import the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** together. Your tests will import the target code, which can be either the **Baseline** or the **Mutant** and your job is to design the test in a way, such that it produces different outputs when we switch out the imported target code from the **Baseline** to the **Muntant**.

Therefore, there is no point in re-implementing the code yourself, since the test should examine the imported code, not a recreation it.

There is also no `mutant` module, so imports like `from mutant.sieve import sieve` will result in `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mutant'`. This makes the test case useless.

# Scientific Debugging

Scientific debugging is a systematic debugging approach based on the scientific method. The process follows a loop of:

- Hypothesis
- Experiment
- Conclusion

## Hypotheses

Each hypothesis should describe an assumption you have about the code. Hypotheses are the key aspect of scientific debugging, and should be written detailed and with great care.

- Base hypotheses on the findings of previous experiments.
- Don't repeat hypotheses you have already made.
- Don't base hypotheses on untested assumptions.

Hypotheses loosely follow this template: I hypothesize that [assumption] holds when [given inputs]. I predict that [assumed result] and I will verify this by [more explanation and experiment description].

## Experiments

After stating a hypothesis, you create an experiment to test it. Each experiment will contain a Python test case, which imports and calls the target code. Once you stated the test case, our system will add it to the target code and execute it. First, it runs your code on the **Baseline** (the correct code, without the mutant) and gives you the output. When that is finished, it applies the **Mutant** to the code and runs your code again.

Each experiment should contain a relevant prediction based on your hypothesis and a way to verify that prediction based on the output. Basically, you run the target code and predict the output based on your hypothesis. Therefore, add print statements to print out relevant values, which will help you understand what the code is doing.

Your experiment is agnostic of which version of the code it is hadling (**Baseline** or **Mutant**). Therefore, never use add print statements like `print(f"baseline output: {output}")` or `print(f"mutant output: {output}")`. This will make your experiment results confusing and useless. Instead, use use agnostic statements like `print(f"output: {output}")`.

Some notes:
- Keep your experiments/tests short and simple.
- Use print statements liberally in your experiments.
- Never recreate the mutant as part of your experiment/test.

Here is an example experiment:

### Example Experiment

```python
from sieve import sieve

def test__sieve():
    output = sieve(5)
    print(f"output = {output}")
    assert len(output) > 0
```

### Example Experiment Results

#### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
output = [2, 3, 5]
```

#### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
output = []
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 7, in <module>
    test__sieve()
  File "test.py", line 6, in test__sieve
    assert len(output) > 0
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```
The experiment exited with exit code 1

## Conclusions

After every experiment, write a conclusion that summarizes on the results. Summarize your conclusion in a short list, so you can refer back to them easily.

Pay close attention to experiment output:
- Did the baseline have any errors? Does the experiment need to be fixed?
- Are there any discrepancies between the output of the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**? That means you detected mutant.

It is already enough to find a single input that can distinguish between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**. Exceptions and timeouts also count. Any difference in behavior. Once you have found an input that triggers a difference, you can continue and write the test case.

Otherwise, keep creating hypotheses and experiments until you have found the right inputs. Then you can finish debugging and write the mutant-killing test.

## Tests

Once you have found any inputs that cause a difference in behavior, you can write a test that kills the mutant. Similarly to experiments, when you finished writing your code, we will copy the test case and execute it against the **Baseline**, i.e., the regular program without the mutant, then apply the **Mutant** and execute it again.

The test kills the mutant if, and only if, the test passes when executed with the **Baseline** and fails when executed with the **Mutant**.

Failing is defined as exiting with exitcode 1 here. This means that the test needs to result in either a *a failed assertion*, an *uncaught exception* or a *timeout* when executed on the **Mutant**.

This means that you have to include relevant assertions in your test, unless the mutant raises an exception or results in a timeout. Create relevant assertions based on your experiment findings. This is vital, as your test will be useless otherwise.

Include a relevant docstring commnent with a summary of your findings. The comment should explain what the test checks for and why. Include relevant findings from your conclusions.

Here is an example test:

### Example Test

```python
from rpn_eval import rpn_eval

def test__rpn_eval():
    """
    Test whether operator argumenets are interpreted in the correct order. The input represents the calculation (8 / 2), which will lead to different results if the argument order is swapped, since (2 / 8) != (8 / 2).
    """
    output = rpn_eval([8.0, 2.0, '/'])
    assert output == 4.0
```

#### Running Test on Baseline
```

```

#### Running Test on Mutant
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
    test__rpn_eval()
  File "test.py", line 8, in test__rpn_eval
    assert output == 4.0
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```
The test exited with exit code 1.

## Equivalent Mutants

Some mutants may be equivalent. Equivalent mutants don't change the behavior of the code, meaning they cannot be detected by a test. An example would be changing `x=a+b` to `x=b+a`. If you believe a mutant to be equivalent, write the `## Equivalent Mutant` headline and give a short description of why you think the mutant is equivalent. Include some information from your experiments to back up your claims. Afterwards, try to prove yourself wrong by doing more experiments. See if you can maybe find a difference between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** anyways.

Example:

I believe the mutant is equivalent. The change [mutant change] doesn't affect the way [some result] is computed. My experiments show that [tried inputs] did not result in any different behavior in the mutant, which suggest [more explanation]. Since my past tries have failed to make the mutant behave differently, I will now try [new approach].

# Debugging


## Hypothesis
I hypothesize that the mutant change in `PRETTIFY_RE` where `re.DOTALL` is modified to `re.DOTALL` using a division operator (/) instead of a bitwise OR operator (|) will result in a failure when the regular expression is executed. This is because the division operator is not valid for combining flags, leading to an error or unexpected behavior. Therefore, I predict that running a test that utilizes `PRETTIFY_RE` will illustrate a difference in behavior between the Baseline and the Mutant.

## Experiment
We will create a test case that uses the `PRETTIFY_RE` regex to check when the input contains text in round brackets and see if it matches correctly according to the regex patterns. We can use a sample input string that includes various punctuation, spaces, and round brackets.

```python
from string_utils._regex import PRETTIFY_RE

def test__prettify_re():
    """
    Test if PRETTIFY_RE captures text in round brackets correctly.
    Since the mutant changes the way flags are combined, we expect a failure or different behavior with the mutant.
    """
    test_string = "This is a test string (with some text) and more."
    match = PRETTIFY_RE['LEFT_SPACE'].search(test_string)
    print(f"match = {match}")
    assert match is not None  # Should find a match in the baseline case.
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
match = None
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 12, in <module>
    test__prettify_re()
  File "test.py", line 11, in test__prettify_re
    assert match is not None  # Should find a match in the baseline case.
AssertionError
```
The experiment exited with exit code 1.

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```

    'LEFT_SPACE': re.compile(
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for &: 'float' and 'int'
```
The experiment exited with exit code 1.


## Conclusion
The experiment has shown that the mutant causes a `TypeError` due to the incorrect combination of flags using the division operator instead of the bitwise OR operator. In the Baseline, the regex compiled correctly and returned `match = None` indicating no match was found. In contrast, the Mutant produced a `TypeError`.

This difference in behavior indicates that the mutant is not equivalent to the Baseline because it generates an error during its execution while the Baseline does not raise this error.

## Test
Now, I will write a test case that captures this difference and will fail on the mutant while passing on the baseline.

```python
from string_utils._regex import PRETTIFY_RE

def test__prettify_re_mutant_detection():
    """
    Test to ensure PRETTIFY_RE behaves correctly. 
    Given the mutant change causes a TypeError due to invalid flag combination,
    we expect the test to raise an error on the mutant.
    """
    try:
        test_string = "This is a test string (with some text) and more."
        match = PRETTIFY_RE['LEFT_SPACE'].search(test_string)
        assert match is not None  # We should find a match in the baseline case.
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Caught an exception: {e}")
        assert isinstance(e, TypeError)  # We specifically want to detect TypeErrors in the mutant.
```


### Test Results

Your test did not correctly identify the mutant. Remember: Your test needs to pass when executed with the baseline, and fail when executed with the mutant. Please adjust your test case or perform more experiments.


## Hypothesis
I hypothesize that since the mutant causes a `TypeError` during the importation of the regex patterns due to an invalid combination of the `re.MULTILINE` and `re.DOTALL` using the division operator, this behavior can be detected by executing a test without the need to perform a regex match.

I predict that trying to access `PRETTIFY_RE['LEFT_SPACE']` and running a simple test to check for the presence of this regex will successfully pass on the Baseline but will raise an exception on the Mutant due to the aforementioned issue with the regex.

## Experiment
We will create an experiment that simply checks if we can access `PRETTIFY_RE['LEFT_SPACE']`. This access should be successful on the Baseline but will cause an error on the Mutant.

```python
from string_utils._regex import PRETTIFY_RE

def test__prettify_re_import():
    """
    Test if PRETTIFY_RE can be accessed correctly.
    The mutant is expected to raise an error upon trying to access this regex due to invalid flag combination.
    """
    try:
        left_space_regex = PRETTIFY_RE['LEFT_SPACE']
        print(f"Successfully accessed regex: {left_space_regex}")
    except Exception as error:
        print(f"Error occurred: {error}")
        assert isinstance(error, TypeError)  # Capture if the mutant raises a TypeError
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Successfully accessed regex: re.compile('(\\s"[^"]+"(?=[?.:!,;])|(?<=\\S)"[^"]+"\\s|(?<=\\S)"[^"]+"(?=[?.:!,;])|\\s\\([^)]+\\)(?=[?.:!,;])|(?<=\\S)\\([^)]+\\)\\s|(?<=\\S)(\\([^)]+\\))(?=[?.:!,;]))', re.MULTILINE|re.DOTALL)

The experiment exited with exit code 1.

Your experiment resulted in exitcode 0 for the baseline and exitcode 1 for the the mutant. This means that your experiment can successfully kill the mutant. Next, you should create a test from your experiment


## Test
Now that we have confirmed that accessing the `PRETTIFY_RE['LEFT_SPACE']` raises a `TypeError` in the mutant, I will write a test case that captures this behavior clearly. The test will pass on the Baseline and fail on the Mutant.

```python
from string_utils._regex import PRETTIFY_RE

def test__prettify_re_mutant_detection():
    """
    Test if accessing PRETTIFY_RE['LEFT_SPACE'] causes an error in the mutant.
    The baseline should allow access to the regex without issue.
    In contrast, the mutant should raise a TypeError, which we expect to fail the assertion.
    """
    try:
        left_space_regex = PRETTIFY_RE['LEFT_SPACE']
        print("Successfully accessed the regex pattern.")
        assert left_space_regex is not None  # Ensures we could access it correctly.
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Exception caught: {e}")
        assert isinstance(e, TypeError)  # Specifically, we want to know if it’s a TypeError in the mutant.
```

### Summary
The test checks for access to the `LEFT_SPACE` regex pattern in the `PRETTIFY_RE`. In the Baseline, this should work without any issues, but in the Mutant, it should raise a `TypeError`. This test will serve to verify the mutant effectively.


# Results

The LLM found a test case that detects the mutant.
