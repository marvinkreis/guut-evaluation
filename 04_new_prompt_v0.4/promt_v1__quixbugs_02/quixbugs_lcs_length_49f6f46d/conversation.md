You are a helpful AI coding assistant, who is proficient in python coding and debugging.


We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to use scientific debugging to gain an understanding of the mutant, and then write a test case that kills the mutant.

This is an automated process, consisting of a loop of "hypothesis", "experiment" and "conclusion" until you are ready to write a "test" or to declare the mutant "equivalent". During this loop, you will submit "experiment" code and "test" code, which our system is going to parse and then execute for you. Since your messages will be automatically parsed, pay close attention to the format we expect of your messages. This includes the markdown headlines (e.g., "# Experiment"). Do not write any markdown headlines other than the ones described below.


# Output Format

The process will use the following format:

    # Task
    (we will provide the code under test and the mutant)

    # Debugging

    ## Hypothesis
    (your hypothesis)

    ## Experiment
    (your experiment code and prediction)

    ### Experiment Results
    #### Running Experiment on Baseline
    (we will write the results)
    #### Running Experiment on Mutant
    (we will write the results)

    ## Conclusion
    (your conclusion)

    [repeat ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until you found inputs that can detect the mutant]

    ## Test
    (your mutant-killing test)

    ### Test Results
    #### Running Test on Baseline
    (we will give the results)
    #### Running Test on Mutant
    (we will give the results)

    [repeat ("Test") or ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until a test successfully killed the mutant]

    [at any point, if you believe the mutant to be equivalent to the original code]
    ## Equivalent Mutant
    (a short explanation about why the mutant is equivalent)

## Notes

Make sure that `## Experiment` is always followed by `### Experiment Results` and `## Test` is always followed by `## Test Results`. This is important for parsing your responses.


# Output Format for Code

Write all code in markdown code blocks and specify the language, e.g.:

    ```python
    // python code here
    ```

Make sure to import all necessary functions in every code snippet. You can assume that all python files we list are in the current directory (`.`). For example, you can import the following file with `import guut.config as config` or `from guut.config import example`:

```python guut/config.py
def example():
    pass
```

Output all code in single Python function called `test__<function_name>` with no parameters. Don't use any testing frameworks.


# Running code

Whenever you submit a test case (experiment or test), our system will run your code on the **Baseline** (the correct code, without the mutant) and give you the output. When that is finished, it applies the **Mutant** to the code and runs your code again.

This means that your test case can only use one version of the target code (**Baseline** or **Mutant**) at once. You test case simply imports the target code and runs it, without knowing if it imported the **Baseline** or the **Mutant**. Since the system will run your test case once with the **Baseline** and once with the **Mutant**, you will still get the output for both versions.

Again, you cannot import the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** together. Your tests will import the target code, which can be either the **Baseline** or the **Mutant** and your job is to design the test in a way, such that it produces different outputs when we switch out the imported target code from the **Baseline** to the **Muntant**.

Therefore, there is no point in re-implementing the code yourself, since the test should examine the imported code, not a recreation it.

There is also no `mutant` module, so imports like `from mutant.sieve import sieve` will result in `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mutant'`. This makes the test case useless.

# Scientific Debugging

Scientific debugging is a systematic debugging approach based on the scientific method. The process follows a loop of:

- Hypothesis
- Experiment
- Conclusion

## Hypotheses

Each hypothesis should describe an assumption you have about the code. Hypotheses are the key aspect of scientific debugging, and should be written detailed and with great care.

- Base hypotheses on the findings of previous experiments.
- Don't repeat hypotheses you have already made.
- Don't base hypotheses on untested assumptions.

Hypotheses loosely follow this template: I hypothesize that [assumption] holds when [given inputs]. I predict that [assumed result] and I will verify this by [more explanation and experiment description].

## Experiments

After stating a hypothesis, you create an experiment to test it. Each experiment will contain a Python test case, which imports and calls the target code. Once you stated the test case, our system will add it to the target code and execute it. First, it runs your code on the **Baseline** (the correct code, without the mutant) and gives you the output. When that is finished, it applies the **Mutant** to the code and runs your code again.

Each experiment should contain a relevant prediction based on your hypothesis and a way to verify that prediction based on the output. Basically, you run the target code and predict the output based on your hypothesis. Therefore, add print statements to print out relevant values, which will help you understand what the code is doing.

Some notes:
- Keep your experiments/tests short and simple.
- Use print statements liberally in your experiments.
- Never recreate the mutant as part of your experiment/test.

Here is an example experiment:

### Example Experiment

```python
from sieve import sieve

def test__sieve():
    output = sieve(5)
    print(f"output = {output}")
    assert len(output) > 0
```

### Example Experiment Results

#### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
output = [2, 3, 5]
```

#### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
output = []
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 7, in <module>
    test__sieve()
  File "test.py", line 6, in test__sieve
    assert len(output) > 0
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```
The experiment exited with exit code 1

## Conclusions

After every experiment, write a conclusion that summarizes on the results. Summarize your conclusion in a short list, so you can refer back to them easily.

Pay close attention to experiment output:
- Did the baseline have any errors? Does the experiment need to be fixed?
- Are there any discrepancies between the output of the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**? That means you detected mutant.

It is already enough to find a single input that can distinguish between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**. Exceptions and timeouts also count. Any difference in behavior. Once you have found an input that triggers a difference, you can continue and write the test case.

Otherwise, keep creating hypotheses and experiments until you have found the right inputs. Then you can finish debugging and write the mutant-killing test.

## Tests

When you are ready, you will need to write a test that kills the mutant. Similarly to experiments, once you finished writing your code, we will copy the test case and execute it against the **Baseline**, i.e., the regular program without the mutant, then apply the **Mutant** and execute it again.

The test kills the mutant if, and only if, the test passes when executed with the **Baseline** and fails when executed with the **Mutant**. This means that you have to include relevant assertions in your test, unless the mutant raises an exception or results in a timeout.

Include a relevant docstring commnent with a summary of your findings. The comment should explain what the test checks for and why. Include relevant findings from your conclusions.

Here is an example test:

### Example Test

```python
from rpn_eval import rpn_eval

def test__rpn_eval():
    """
    Test whether operator argumenets are interpreted in the correct order. The input represents the calculation (8 / 2), which will lead to different results if the argument order is swapped, since (2 / 8) != (8 / 2).
    """
    output = rpn_eval([8.0, 2.0, '/'])
    assert output == 4.0
```

#### Running Test on Baseline
```

```

#### Running Test on Mutant
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
    test__rpn_eval()
  File "test.py", line 8, in test__rpn_eval
    assert output == 4.0
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```
The test exited with exit code 1.

## Equivalent Mutants

Some mutants may be equivalent. Equivalent mutants don't change the behavior of the code, meaning they cannot be detected by a test. An example would be changing `x=a+b` to `x=b+a`. If you believe a mutant to be equivalent, write the `## Equivalent Mutant` headline and give a short description of why you think the mutant is equivalent. Include some information from your experiments to back up your claims. Afterwards, try to prove yourself wrong by doing more experiments. See if you can maybe find a difference between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** anyways.

Example:

I believe the mutant is equivalent. The change [mutant change] doesn't affect the way [some result] is computed. My experiments show that [tried inputs] did not result in any different behavior in the mutant, which suggest [more explanation]. Since my past tries have failed to make the mutant behave differently, I will now try [new approach].

# Debugging


## Hypothesis
I hypothesize that the mutant changes the way the length of the longest common substring is calculated when characters match. Specifically, I believe that the mutant will return a longer common substring in cases where consecutive matches occur, but it will fail to do so under certain scenarios compared to the original implementation. By examining the examples provided, I predict that when testing with inputs that have long substrings, the mutant will yield a different result than the baseline implementation.

## Experiment
I will create an experiment to test the behavior of both the baseline and the mutant with strings that contain long common substrings. I will use the inputs 'abcdef' and 'zabcdefg' because they have 'abcdef' as a common substring. I predict the baseline will correctly return 6, while the mutant may return a lower value due to how it tracks previous matches.

```python
from lcs_length import lcs_length

def test_lcs_length():
    s = 'abcdef'
    t = 'zabcdefg'
    output = lcs_length(s, t)
    print(f"Output for input ('{s}', '{t}') = {output}")
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output for input ('abcdef', 'zabcdefg') = 6
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output for input ('abcdef', 'zabcdefg') = 1
```


## Conclusion
The experiment results showed a clear discrepancy between the baseline and the mutant. The baseline implementation correctly returned the length of the longest common substring, which is 6 for the inputs 'abcdef' and 'zabcdefg'. However, the mutant returned 1, indicating it is incorrectly calculating the length of the longest common substring due to the changes made in the indexing logic. This confirms that the mutant is not equivalent to the baseline implementation, as it produces different outputs for the same inputs.

## Test
I will now write a test case specifically designed to kill the mutant by verifying that it correctly calculates the length of the longest common substring. The test will use the same inputs as the experiment ('abcdef', 'zabcdefg') and will assert that the output is as expected, which is 6.

```python
from lcs_length import lcs_length

def test_lcs_length_kill_mutant():
    """
    Test for longest common substring length. 
    The input ('abcdef', 'zabcdefg') has 'abcdef' as a common substring with a length of 6. 
    The mutant should return a different length (1), while the baseline correctly returns 6.
    """
    assert lcs_length('abcdef', 'zabcdefg') == 6
```


# Results

The LLM found a test case that detects the mutant.
