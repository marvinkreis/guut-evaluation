You are a helpful AI coding assistant, who is proficient in python coding and debugging.


We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to use scientific debugging to gain an understanding of the mutant, and then write a test case that kills the mutant.

This is an automated process, consisting of a loop of "hypothesis", "experiment" and "conclusion" until you are ready to write a "test" or to declare the mutant "equivalent". During this loop, you will submit "experiment" code and "test" code, which our system is going to parse and then execute for you. Since your messages will be automatically parsed, pay close attention to the format we expect of your messages. This includes the markdown headlines (e.g., "# Experiment"). Do not write any markdown headlines other than the ones described below.


# Output Format

The process will use the following format:

    # Task
    (we will provide the code under test and the mutant)

    # Debugging

    ## Hypothesis
    (your hypothesis)

    ## Experiment
    (your experiment code and prediction)

    ### Experiment Results
    #### Running Experiment on Baseline
    (we will write the baseline results)
    #### Running Experiment on Mutant
    (we will write the mutant results)

    ## Conclusion
    (your conclusion)

    [repeat ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until you found inputs that can detect the mutant]

    ## Test
    (your mutant-killing test)

    ### Test Results
    #### Running Test on Baseline
    (we will give the results)
    #### Running Test on Mutant
    (we will give the results)

    [repeat ("Test") or ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until a test successfully kills the mutant]

    [at any point, if you believe the mutant to be equivalent to the original code]
    ## Equivalent Mutant
    (a short explanation about why the mutant is equivalent)

## Notes

Make sure that `## Experiment` is always followed by `### Experiment Results` and `## Test` is always followed by `## Test Results`. This is important for parsing your responses.


# Output Format for Code

Write all code in markdown code blocks and specify the language, e.g.,

    ```python
    // python code here
    ```

Make sure to import all necessary functions in every code snippet. You can assume that all python files we list are in the current directory (`.`). For example, you can import the following file with `import guut.config as config` or `from guut.config import example`:

```python guut/config.py
def example():
    pass
```

Output all code in single Python function called `test__<function_name>` with no parameters. Don't use any testing frameworks. Don't call the test function yourself.


# Running code

Whenever you submit a test case (experiment or test), our system will run your code on the **Baseline** (the correct code, without the mutant) and give you the output. When that is finished, it applies the **Mutant** to the code and runs your code again.

This means that your test case can only use one version of the target code (**Baseline** or **Mutant**) at once. Your test case simply imports the target code and runs it, without knowing if it imported the **Baseline** or the **Mutant**. Since the system will run your test case once with the **Baseline** and once with the **Mutant**, you will still get the output for both versions.

Again, you cannot import the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** together. Your tests will import the target code, which can be either the **Baseline** or the **Mutant**. It is your job to design the test in a way, such that it produces different outputs when we switch out the imported target code from the **Baseline** to the **Mutant**.

Therefore, there is no point in re-implementing the code yourself, since the test should examine the imported code, not a recreation of it. Recreating the target code will make your test case useless.

We also do not provide a `mutant` module, so imports like `from mutant.sieve import sieve` will result in `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mutant'`. This makes the test case useless.

Our system also cannot respond to instructive comments like `# Please run this with the mutant:`. The system executes *your entire experiment/test* with the **Baseline**, then executes *your entire experiment/test* with the **Mutant**. Leaving instructions in comments won't change this, and will instead make your test case useless.

# Scientific Debugging

Scientific debugging is a systematic debugging approach based on the scientific method. The process follows a loop of:

- Hypothesis
- Experiment
- Conclusion

## Hypotheses

Each hypothesis should describe an assumption you have about the code. Hypotheses are the key aspect of scientific debugging, and should be written detailed and with great care.

- Base hypotheses on the findings of previous experiments.
- Don't repeat hypotheses you have already made.
- Don't base hypotheses on untested assumptions.

Predict exactly what will happen. Avoid broad predictions like "Under any of the given inputs, the mutant will behave differently". Instead, write predictions like "The input [input] will satisfy [conditions]

Hypotheses loosely follow this template: Given [observations], I hypothesize that [assumption] holds when [given inputs]. I predict that [assumed result] and I will verify this by [more explanation and experiment description].

## Experiments

After stating a hypothesis, you create an experiment to test it. Each experiment will contain a Python test case, which imports and calls the target code. Once you stated the test case, our system will add it to the target code and execute it. First, it runs your code on the **Baseline** (the correct code, without the mutant) and gives you the output. When that is finished, it applies the **Mutant** to the code and runs your code again, also giving you the output.

Each experiment should contain a relevant prediction based on your hypothesis and a way to verify that prediction based on the output. Basically, you run the target code and predict the output based on your hypothesis. Therefore, add print statements to print out relevant values, which will help you understand what the code is doing.

Your experiment is agnostic of which version of the code it is handling (**Baseline** or **Mutant**). Therefore, never use add print statements like `print(f"baseline output: {output}")` or `print(f"mutant output: {output}")`. This will make your experiment results confusing and useless. Instead, use print statements that make sense with both versions like `print(f"output: {output}")`.

Some notes:
- Keep your experiments/tests short and simple.
- Use print statements liberally in your experiments.
- Never recreate the mutant as part of your experiment/test.
- Check one input at a time.

Here is an example experiment for a `is_valid_parenthesization` function. See how it prints the output, then checks if the output matches the prediction.

### Example Experiment

```python
from is_valid_parenthesization import is_valid_parenthesization

def test__is_valid_parenthesization():
    """
    Check if the target function correctly handles missing closing parentheses.
    """
    output = is_valid_parenthesization('(()')
    assert output == False
```

## Running Experiment on Baseline

```

```

## Running Experiment on Mutant

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
    test__is_valid_parenthesization()
  File "test.py", line 8, in test__is_valid_parenthesization
    assert output == False
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```
The experiment exited with exit code 1.

## Conclusions

After every experiment, write a conclusion that summarizes on the results. Summarize your conclusion in a short list, so you can refer back to them easily.

Pay close attention to experiment output:
- Did the baseline have any errors? Does the experiment need to be fixed?
- Are there any discrepancies between the output of the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**? That means you detected mutant.

It is already enough to find a single input that can distinguish between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**. Any difference in output counts, as well as any difference in exceptions or timeouts. Any difference in behavior. Once you have found an input that triggers a difference, you can continue and write the test case that fails when it observes the **Mutant** behavior.

Otherwise, keep creating hypotheses and experiments until you have found the right inputs. Then you can finish debugging and write the mutant-killing test.

## Tests

Once you have found any inputs that cause a difference in behavior, you can write a test that kills the mutant. Similarly to experiments, when you finished writing your code, we will copy the test case and execute it against the **Baseline**, i.e., the regular program without the mutant, then apply the **Mutant** and execute it again.

The test kills the mutant if, and only if, the test passes when executed with the **Baseline** and fails when executed with the **Mutant**. Here, failing is defined as exiting with exit code 1. This means that the test needs to result in either a *failed assertion*, an *uncaught exception* or a *timeout* when executed on the **Mutant**.

This means that you have to include relevant assertions in your test, unless the mutant raises an exception or results in a timeout. If the mutant raises an exception or error, do not use a `try-except` block to catch it. Adding a `try-except` block that handles the exception means that the exception will not make the test case fail.

Include a relevant docstring comment with a summary of your findings. The comment should explain what the test checks for and why. Include relevant findings from your conclusions.

Here is an example test for a `rpn_eval` function that evaluates expressions in Reverse Polish notation:

### Example Test

```python
from rpn_eval import rpn_eval

def test__rpn_eval():
    """
    Test whether operator arguments are interpreted in the correct order. The input represents the calculation (8 / 2),
    which will lead to different results if the argument order is swapped, since (2 / 8) != (8 / 2).
    """
    output = rpn_eval([8.0, 2.0, '/'])
    assert output == 4.0
```

#### Example Test Results

##### Running Test on Baseline
```

```

##### Running Test on Mutant
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
    test__rpn_eval()
  File "test.py", line 8, in test__rpn_eval
    assert output == 4.0
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```
The test exited with exit code 1.

## Equivalent Mutants

Some mutants may be equivalent. Equivalent mutants don't change the behavior of the code, meaning they cannot be detected by a test. An example would be changing `x=a+b` to `x=b+a`. If you believe a mutant to be equivalent, write the `## Equivalent Mutant` headline and give a short description of why you think the mutant is equivalent. Include some information from your experiments to back up your claims. Afterwards, try to prove yourself wrong by doing more experiments. See if you can maybe find a difference between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** anyways.

Example:

I believe the mutant is equivalent. The change [mutant change] doesn't affect the way the target code computes [some result]. My previous tests show that [tried inputs] did not result in any different behavior in the mutant, which suggest [more explanation]. I will now try to detect the mutant anyways. Since my past tries have failed to detect the mutant, I will now try [new approach].

## Strategy

The first goal is always to cover the mutant, meaning to execute the part of the code it changes. Take a look at the target code and check which conditions your experiment/test needs to meet in order to execute the mutant (for example, passing parameters that meet certain if conditions), then create an experiment that meets those conditions.

Keep your experiments and tests short, so they don't fail because of accidental mistakes in your code. Try only one or two inputs at a time. Shorter experiments are also easier to understand and reason about.

# Debugging


## Hypothesis
Given the observed behavior of the `is_email` function, I hypothesize that changing the line `head = head.replace(' ', '')[1:-1]` to `head = head.replace(' ', '')[2:-1]` in the mutant will affect the validity of email addresses formatted as quoted strings with escaped spaces. Specifically, I predict that this will cause the mutant to incorrectly handle certain valid email formats that previously passed validation, particularly those with leading spaces after the opening quote.

## Experiment
I will create a test case using an email that contains a quoted string with leading spaces after the quote. I expect that the baseline version of the function will correctly identify the email as valid, while the mutant version will reject it as invalid due to the change in string slicing.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_email

def test__is_email():
    """

    The input has leading spaces after the opening quote in the valid email format.

    input_email = '" test@example.com"'  # Valid email with leading space after the opening quote
    output = is_email(input_email)
    assert output == True  # Expecting this to be valid in the baseline
```

```
The experiment exited with exit code 1.


## Conclusion
The results indicate that the `is_email` function produced the same result for both the baseline and the mutant, rejecting the email `'" test@example.com"'` as invalid. Therefore, this input did not successfully distinguish between the two versions of the code.

It seems that the email validation might depend on other aspects beyond just the single line we modified in the mutant. This suggests that the mutation did not affect the behavior as I previously hypothesized in the context of handling the leading space issue.

Now, I need to formulate a new hypothesis and experiment to test other aspects of the email validation logic that may be relevant to distinguishing the mutant from the baseline.

## Hypothesis
Given the previous failure, I hypothesize that the mutant may exhibit different behavior when tested with an email that is valid but has escaped quotes or a structured format which might not be handled correctly by the mutant version. Specifically, I will test an email string with escaped spaces and verify the outcome against the expected email validation.

## Experiment
I will create a new test case with an email that includes escaped characters in a situation that should correctly be validated by the original implementation but may be impacted by the mutated code behavior. The email I'll check will be `"\\ test@example.com"` which should be valid.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_email

## Conclusion
The results indicate that both the baseline and the mutant versions of the `is_email` function returned the same result, rejecting the escaped email input `'"\\ test@example.com"'` as invalid. This means that the condition being tested is likely not reflecting the difference induced by the mutant.

Since previous experiments have not yielded a distinguishing input, I will pivot to explore a different aspect of the email validation implementation. This time, I will try to test an email that uses typical valid characters without special formatting, where the slicing differences could potentially lead to divergent results.

## Hypothesis
Given the findings from previous experiments, I hypothesize that a straightforward email format, such as `"valid.email@example.com"`, which does not involve escaped characters or unusual formatting, may reveal differing behavior between the baseline and the mutant versions. I predict that this input should be correctly validated in the baseline, whereas the mutant may erroneously validate or invalidate it due to the string manipulation error.

## Experiment
I will create a test case using a standard, properly formatted email address.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_email

def test__is_email_standard():
    """
    Test whether the 'is_email' function handles a standard valid email correctly.
    The input is a typical email format which should be accepted as valid.
    The mutant may exhibit an incorrect response due to the change in string slicing.
    """
    input_email = "valid.email@example.com"  # Standard valid email
    output = is_email(input_email)
    assert output == True  # Expecting this to be valid in the baseline
```


### Experiment Results

```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```

```


## Conclusion
Since there were no errors or assertions raised with either the baseline or the mutant code during the execution of the test, it suggests that both versions successfully validated the email input `"valid.email@example.com"` as valid. This indicates that the change in the mutant code – modifying the string slicing from `[1:-1]` to `[2:-1]` – did not affect recognition of standard email formats.

Given that I have not yet identified any inputs that produce a difference in output between the baseline and mutant versions, it's essential to refine my approach to discover a suitable test case that can exploit the mutation.

## Hypothesis
I will now hypothesize that the mutant might not handle invalid email formats with multiple "@" signs correctly. A classic candidate for this would be an email such as `"name@@example.com"`, which should be invalid regardless of the version. However, I will also include a format that has a valid escape sequence just before an invalid one.

## Experiment
I will create a test case testing multiple "@" signs in the email input. This email format should trigger a divergence between acceptable patterns, given that the escaper is involved in the logic for incorrect emails.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_email

def test__is_email_multiple_at():
    """
    Test whether the 'is_email' function handles emails with multiple '@' characters correctly.
    The input should be invalid in both implementations, but we need to confirm no changes in rejection behavior.
    """
    input_email = "name@@example.com"  # Invalid email format due to multiple '@'
    output = is_email(input_email)
    assert output == False  # Expecting this to be invalid in both versions
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```

```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```

```


## Conclusion
The results indicate that both the baseline and the mutant versions of the `is_email` function successfully validated the input `"name@@example.com"` as invalid without raising any exceptions. This means that the specific change in the mutant, which altered how strings were sliced, did not affect the evaluation of emails with multiple "@" characters.

Since previous tests have not revealed any discrepancies between the behavior of the baseline and the mutant, I will change my approach in search of a suitable distinguishing input.

## Hypothesis
I hypothesize that a case where the email string has escaped sequences in prohibited formats might produce a differing behavior. A plausible test case could be an email formatted as `"name@domain\\.com"` where the backslash escapes characters in such a way that could potentially lead to divergent outputs between the baseline and the mutant due to misinterpretation of the actual format of the email address.

## Experiment
I will implement a test case centered around this idea:

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_email

def test__is_email_invalid_escape():
    """
    Test whether the 'is_email' function handles an email with invalid escape sequences correctly.
    The input email has an escape character which should invalidate the email format.
    The mutant may handle this incorrectly due to the changes in string processing.
    """
    input_email = "name@domain\\.com"  # Invalid email format due to an escape character
    output = is_email(input_email)
    assert output == False  # Expecting this to be invalid in both versions
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```

```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```

```


## Conclusion
Both the baseline and the mutant versions successfully processed the input `"name@domain\\.com"` without raising any assertions or errors, indicating that both correctly identified it as invalid. This suggests that the specific change in the mutant code does not affect the handling of emails with invalid escape characters.

Since my previous hypotheses have not led to the identification of a distinguishing input, I will need to consider other areas of potential impact from the mutant code modification. I will explore more complex scenarios involving escaped quotes and edge cases that involve valid but intricate email formats.

## Hypothesis
I hypothesize that an email formatted with valid characters but unusual spacing or escaped sequences, such as `' "valid-email@example.com"'`, might trigger different handling in the mutant due to its modified slicing behavior. This address has an unexpected leading space, which can only be fully addressed by the original implementation.

## Experiment
I will construct a test case with this revised input.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_email

def test__is_email_leading_space():
    """
    Test whether the 'is_email' function correctly identifies emails with leading spaces.
    This test uses a standard email format but includes a leading space which may be affected by the mutant's change.
    It is expected that the baseline will recognize it as invalid, while the mutant may misinterpret it.
    """
    input_email = ' "valid-email@example.com"'  # Invalid due to leading space
    output = is_email(input_email)
    assert output == False  # Expecting this to be invalid in both versions
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```

```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```

```


## Conclusion
Both the baseline and the mutant versions processed the email input `' "valid-email@example.com"'` and correctly identified it as invalid without raising any assertions or errors. This indicates that the mutant modification (changing the string slicing from `[1:-1]` to `[2:-1]`) did not affect the handling of emails with spaces or quotes.

At this stage, it seems I have not been able to identify a test input that can differentiate between the baseline and mutant implementations of the `is_email` function. This has led me to reconsider the approach to ensure we can successfully distinguish the two versions.

## Equivalent Mutant
After multiple tests attempting to reveal differences in behavior between the baseline and mutant versions of the `is_email` function under various scenarios, I conclude that the mutation introduced does not lead to any effective change in how the function processes valid and invalid email formats. This implies that the mutant is functionally equivalent to the baseline code.

The specific mutation of changing the string slicing does not impact outcomes in handling normal, quoted, or escaped email formats. The escape logic and handling of characters in email strings ultimately remain correct enough in both implementations to allow successful validation or rejection as needed. Therefore, the change does not reflect a real divergence in outcome.

I will proceed to finalize my testing efforts without finding valid inputs that reveal different behaviors, confirming the conclusion that the mutant is equivalent to the baseline.


You claimed that the mutant as equivalent.

Now, try other experiments to check if you can prove yourself wrong. Try new approaches or new inputs you haven't tried yet. See if you can maybe find a difference between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** anyways.


## Revised Hypothesis
To challenge the assertion of equivalence, I will hypothesize that the change in slicing of the string in the mutant could lead to misinterpretation of more complex email addresses, especially those with escaped characters and hybrid formatting that might not be commonly used but are valid. In particular, I will explore an email that has escaped characters in both the username and domain parts.

## Experiment
I will create a test case centered around an unusual email format, such as: `"\"valid@domain.com"`. The expectation is that the baseline version will handle this scenario correctly due to its original slicing behavior, whereas the mutant may mishandle it due to its adjusted string manipulation.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_email

def test__is_email_escaped_quotes():
    """
    Test whether the 'is_email' function correctly identifies emails with escaped quotes.
    The email has escaped quotes which should be seen as valid.
    The mutant's modified handling may lead to an incorrect result.
    """
    input_email = '"valid@domain.com"'  # Valid email format but with quotes
    output = is_email(input_email)
    assert output == True  # Expecting this to be valid in the baseline
```

I will run this test to see if there is a difference in handling between the baseline implementation and the mutant.

The experiment exited with exit code 1.


## Conclusion
The results from the experiment show that both the baseline and the mutant versions of the `is_email` function failed to validate the email input `'"valid@domain.com"'`, indicating that both implementations treat this input as invalid. Consequently, this test did not yield a distinguishing result, as both implementations failed under the same conditions.

Given the failures to prove the mutant's behavior distinct from the baseline, I will now shift focus to testing another unique email format that combines both escaped characters and special characters that might yield unexpected results due to the mutants sliced indexing.

## Hypothesis
I hypothesize that an email with multiple escaped characters in the username portion, particularly with invalid formatting, such as `"user@domain\\.com"`, may expose incorrect handling in the mutant version. The expectation is that the mutant's string slicing logic may not adequately account for complexities involved.

## Experiment
I will construct a new test case using the email format described above.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_email

def test__is_email_escaped_complex():
    """
    Test whether the 'is_email' function handles email strings with complex escape characters correctly.
    The input has an escape character which should invalidate the email format.
    The mutant may not handle this correctly due to the changes in string slicing.
    """
    input_email = "user@domain\\.com"  # Invalid email due to improper escape character
    output = is_email(input_email)
    assert output == False  # Expecting this to be invalid in both versions
```

I will execute this test to determine if a difference in output appears between the baseline and the mutant.

## Test Instructions

You have 2 experiments/tests left.

Please continue by writing a test that kills the mutant. Remember: the test should pass when executed on the baseline but fail on the mutant.

## Test


Based on prior experiments, I will attempt to pinpoint a valid scenario that aligns closely with the mutant's introduced changes yet presents an unexpected outcome. The focus will be on inputs that manipulate escaped characters, specifics around quoting, and improperly formatted sections which might yield differing behavior.

## Test
I will formulate a new test case that uses an email with multiple consecutive spaces and another escaped character. The test intends to highlight how the baseline implementation might treat this scenario correctly, while the mutant may falter due to its altered string slicing.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_email

def test__is_email_consecutive_spaces():
    """
    Test whether the 'is_email' function handles emails with consecutive spaces correctly.
    This input has improper formatting that should be treated as invalid.
    The baseline is expected to yield false while the mutant may misinterpret it as valid due to slicing changes.
    """
    input_email = '"valid   email@domain.com"'  # Invalid due to spaces before 'email'
    output = is_email(input_email)
    assert output == False  # Expecting this to return false in the baseline
```

This test will provide insight into the differing handling of consecutive spaces in email formatting. I will run this test to see if it exposes any differences in behavior between the baseline and mutant implementations.

Your test did not correctly identify the mutant. Remember: Your test needs to pass when executed with the baseline, and fail when executed with the mutant. Please adjust your test case or perform more experiments.


## Revised Approach
Given that previous tests did not reveal significant differences between the baseline and mutant implementations, I will modify my approach to better pinpoint a failing scenario that highlights the effect of the mutant's string slicing change.

## Hypothesis
I will create a test case with an email input that contains escaped characters and unusual configurations expected to be invalid, ensuring that the mutant's logic could misinterpret it. An example would be `"valid.email@domain\\.com"`, which might be correctly identified as valid in the baseline but could potentially fail in the mutant due to inadequate handling of escaped sequences.

## Test
The following test aims to reveal how the mutant handles this specific scenario differently compared to the baseline.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_email

def test__is_email_invalid_with_escaped_dot():
    """
    Test whether the 'is_email' function correctly identifies emails with an escaped dot.
    This input should be seen as invalid due to the improper escape format for a dot.
    The baseline is expected to yield false while the mutant may misinterpret it as valid.
    """
    input_email = "valid.email@domain\\.com"  # Invalid due to improperly escaped character
    output = is_email(input_email)
    assert output == False  # Expecting this to return false in the baseline
```

I will run this test in hopes of identifying a difference in behavior between the baseline and the mutant implementations.
