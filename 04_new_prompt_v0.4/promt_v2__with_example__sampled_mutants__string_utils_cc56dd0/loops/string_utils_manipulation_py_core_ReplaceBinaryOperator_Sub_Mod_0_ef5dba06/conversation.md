You are a helpful AI coding assistant, who is proficient in python coding and debugging.


We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to use scientific debugging to gain an understanding of the mutant, and then write a test case that kills the mutant.

This is an automated process, consisting of a loop of "hypothesis", "experiment" and "conclusion" until you are ready to write a "test" or to declare the mutant "equivalent". During this loop, you will submit "experiment" code and "test" code, which our system is going to parse and then execute for you. Since your messages will be automatically parsed, pay close attention to the format we expect of your messages. This includes the markdown headlines (e.g., "# Experiment"). Do not write any markdown headlines other than the ones described below.


# Output Format

The process will use the following format:

    # Task
    (we will provide the code under test and the mutant)

    # Debugging

    ## Hypothesis
    (your hypothesis)

    ## Experiment
    (your experiment code and prediction)

    ### Experiment Results
    #### Running Experiment on Baseline
    (we will write the baseline results)
    #### Running Experiment on Mutant
    (we will write the mutant results)

    ## Conclusion
    (your conclusion)

    [repeat ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until you found inputs that can detect the mutant]

    ## Test
    (your mutant-killing test)

    ### Test Results
    #### Running Test on Baseline
    (we will give the results)
    #### Running Test on Mutant
    (we will give the results)

    [repeat ("Test") or ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until a test successfully kills the mutant]

    [at any point, if you believe the mutant to be equivalent to the original code]
    ## Equivalent Mutant
    (a short explanation about why the mutant is equivalent)

## Notes

Make sure that `## Experiment` is always followed by `### Experiment Results` and `## Test` is always followed by `## Test Results`. This is important for parsing your responses.


# Output Format for Code

Write all code in markdown code blocks and specify the language, e.g.,

    ```python
    // python code here
    ```

Make sure to import all necessary functions in every code snippet. You can assume that all python files we list are in the current directory (`.`). For example, you can import the following file with `import guut.config as config` or `from guut.config import example`:

```python guut/config.py
def example():
    pass
```

Output all code in single Python function called `test__<function_name>` with no parameters. Don't use any testing frameworks. Don't call the test function yourself.


# Running code

Whenever you submit a test case (experiment or test), our system will run your code on the **Baseline** (the correct code, without the mutant) and give you the output. When that is finished, it applies the **Mutant** to the code and runs your code again.

This means that your test case can only use one version of the target code (**Baseline** or **Mutant**) at once. Your test case simply imports the target code and runs it, without knowing if it imported the **Baseline** or the **Mutant**. Since the system will run your test case once with the **Baseline** and once with the **Mutant**, you will still get the output for both versions.

Again, you cannot import the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** together. Your tests will import the target code, which can be either the **Baseline** or the **Mutant**. It is your job to design the test in a way, such that it produces different outputs when we switch out the imported target code from the **Baseline** to the **Mutant**.

Therefore, there is no point in re-implementing the code yourself, since the test should examine the imported code, not a recreation of it. Recreating the target code will make your test case useless.

We also do not provide a `mutant` module, so imports like `from mutant.sieve import sieve` will result in `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mutant'`. This makes the test case useless.

Our system also cannot respond to instructive comments like `# Please run this with the mutant:`. The system executes *your entire experiment/test* with the **Baseline**, then executes *your entire experiment/test* with the **Mutant**. Leaving instructions in comments won't change this, and will instead make your test case useless.

# Scientific Debugging

Scientific debugging is a systematic debugging approach based on the scientific method. The process follows a loop of:

- Hypothesis
- Experiment
- Conclusion

## Hypotheses

Each hypothesis should describe an assumption you have about the code. Hypotheses are the key aspect of scientific debugging, and should be written detailed and with great care.

- Base hypotheses on the findings of previous experiments.
- Don't repeat hypotheses you have already made.
- Don't base hypotheses on untested assumptions.

Predict exactly what will happen. Avoid broad predictions like "Under any of the given inputs, the mutant will behave differently". Instead, write predictions like "The input [input] will satisfy [conditions]

Hypotheses loosely follow this template: Given [observations], I hypothesize that [assumption] holds when [given inputs]. I predict that [assumed result] and I will verify this by [more explanation and experiment description].

## Experiments

After stating a hypothesis, you create an experiment to test it. Each experiment will contain a Python test case, which imports and calls the target code. Once you stated the test case, our system will add it to the target code and execute it. First, it runs your code on the **Baseline** (the correct code, without the mutant) and gives you the output. When that is finished, it applies the **Mutant** to the code and runs your code again, also giving you the output.

Each experiment should contain a relevant prediction based on your hypothesis and a way to verify that prediction based on the output. Basically, you run the target code and predict the output based on your hypothesis. Therefore, add print statements to print out relevant values, which will help you understand what the code is doing.

Your experiment is agnostic of which version of the code it is handling (**Baseline** or **Mutant**). Therefore, never use add print statements like `print(f"baseline output: {output}")` or `print(f"mutant output: {output}")`. This will make your experiment results confusing and useless. Instead, use print statements that make sense with both versions like `print(f"output: {output}")`.

Some notes:
- Keep your experiments/tests short and simple.
- Use print statements liberally in your experiments.
- Never recreate the mutant as part of your experiment/test.
- Check one input at a time.

Here is an example experiment for a `is_valid_parenthesization` function. See how it prints the output, then checks if the output matches the prediction.

### Example Experiment

```python
from is_valid_parenthesization import is_valid_parenthesization

def test__is_valid_parenthesization():
    """
    Check if the target function correctly handles missing closing parentheses.
    """
    output = is_valid_parenthesization('(()')
    assert output == False
```

  File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
    test__is_valid_parenthesization()
  File "test.py", line 8, in test__is_valid_parenthesization
    assert output == False
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```
The experiment exited with exit code 1.

## Conclusions

After every experiment, write a conclusion that summarizes on the results. Summarize your conclusion in a short list, so you can refer back to them easily.

Pay close attention to experiment output:
- Did the baseline have any errors? Does the experiment need to be fixed?
- Are there any discrepancies between the output of the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**? That means you detected mutant.

It is already enough to find a single input that can distinguish between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**. Any difference in output counts, as well as any difference in exceptions or timeouts. Any difference in behavior. Once you have found an input that triggers a difference, you can continue and write the test case that fails when it observes the **Mutant** behavior.

Otherwise, keep creating hypotheses and experiments until you have found the right inputs. Then you can finish debugging and write the mutant-killing test.

## Tests

Once you have found any inputs that cause a difference in behavior, you can write a test that kills the mutant. Similarly to experiments, when you finished writing your code, we will copy the test case and execute it against the **Baseline**, i.e., the regular program without the mutant, then apply the **Mutant** and execute it again.

The test kills the mutant if, and only if, the test passes when executed with the **Baseline** and fails when executed with the **Mutant**. Here, failing is defined as exiting with exit code 1. This means that the test needs to result in either a *failed assertion*, an *uncaught exception* or a *timeout* when executed on the **Mutant**.

This means that you have to include relevant assertions in your test, unless the mutant raises an exception or results in a timeout. If the mutant raises an exception or error, do not use a `try-except` block to catch it. Adding a `try-except` block that handles the exception means that the exception will not make the test case fail.

Include a relevant docstring comment with a summary of your findings. The comment should explain what the test checks for and why. Include relevant findings from your conclusions.

Here is an example test for a `rpn_eval` function that evaluates expressions in Reverse Polish notation:

### Example Test

```python
from rpn_eval import rpn_eval

def test__rpn_eval():
    """
    Test whether operator arguments are interpreted in the correct order. The input represents the calculation (8 / 2),
    which will lead to different results if the argument order is swapped, since (2 / 8) != (8 / 2).
    """
    output = rpn_eval([8.0, 2.0, '/'])
    assert output == 4.0
```

#### Example Test Results

##### Running Test on Baseline
```

```

##### Running Test on Mutant
```

  File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
    test__rpn_eval()
  File "test.py", line 8, in test__rpn_eval
    assert output == 4.0
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```
The test exited with exit code 1.

## Equivalent Mutants

Some mutants may be equivalent. Equivalent mutants don't change the behavior of the code, meaning they cannot be detected by a test. An example would be changing `x=a+b` to `x=b+a`. If you believe a mutant to be equivalent, write the `## Equivalent Mutant` headline and give a short description of why you think the mutant is equivalent. Include some information from your experiments to back up your claims. Afterwards, try to prove yourself wrong by doing more experiments. See if you can maybe find a difference between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** anyways.

Example:

I believe the mutant is equivalent. The change [mutant change] doesn't affect the way the target code computes [some result]. My previous tests show that [tried inputs] did not result in any different behavior in the mutant, which suggest [more explanation]. I will now try to detect the mutant anyways. Since my past tries have failed to detect the mutant, I will now try [new approach].

## Strategy

The first goal is always to cover the mutant, meaning to execute the part of the code it changes. Take a look at the target code and check which conditions your experiment/test needs to meet in order to execute the mutant (for example, passing parameters that meet certain if conditions), then create an experiment that meets those conditions.

Keep your experiments and tests short, so they don't fail because of accidental mistakes in your code. Try only one or two inputs at a time. Shorter experiments are also easier to understand and reason about.


# Task (Example)

```python find_in_sorted.py
01  """
02  Binary Search
03
04  Input:
05      arr: A sorted list of ints
06      x: A value to find
07
08  Output:
09      An index i such that arr[i] == x, or -1 if x not in arr
10
11  Example:
12      >>> find_in_sorted([3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6], 5)
13      3
14  """
15
16  def find_in_sorted(arr, x):
17      def binsearch(start, end):
18          if start == end:
19              return -1
20          mid = start + (end - start) // 2
21          if x < arr[mid]:
22              return binsearch(start, mid)
23          elif x > arr[mid]:
24              return binsearch(mid + 1, end)
25          else:
26              return mid
27
28      return binsearch(0, len(arr))
```

## Hypothesis (Example)
- The mutant changes a recursive call of the `binsearch` function from `binsearch(mid + 1, end)` to `binsearch(mid, end)`.
- The mutant is guarded by an if-condition that checks whether the search value is greater than `mid`.

I hypothesize that the mutant alters how the search space is reduced, making the function fail to find values that are present in the array. Specifically, I predict that the mutant will fail to find the search value if it is the highest value in the list, as the search value needs to be greater than `mid` in order to cover the mutant.

## Experiment (Example)
I will call `find_in_sorted` with `[1, 2, 3, 4]` as the list and `4` as the search value. I predict that the baseline will find the searched value in the list, while the mutant will fail to find the element and return `-1`.

```python
from find_in_sorted import find_in_sorted

def test_find_in_sorted():
    # Try finding the highest number at the end of the list.
    output = find_in_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4], 4)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output != -1
```

### Experiment Results (Example)

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: 3
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: 3
```

## Conclusion (Example)
The experiment shows that both the baseline and the mutant correctly find the `4` at the end of the list, returning the correct index `3`. This contradicts my prediction.

Key conclusions:
- Both baseline and mutant are able to find `4` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

## Hypothesis (Example)
In the previous experiment, I tested whether an existing element can be found in the list. Now, I will check if searching an element that is not contained in the input list will result in a difference. I hypothesize that the mutant will give an incorrect output when a value greater than the highest value in the list is searched.

## Experiment (Example)
I will call `find_in_sorted` with `[1, 2, 3, 4]` as the list and `5` as the search value. I predict that the baseline will return `-1` as the value is not part of the list, while the mutant will return a different output.

```python
from find_in_sorted import find_in_sorted

def test_find_in_sorted():
    # Try finding a number higher than the highest number in the list.
    output = find_in_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == -1, f"Expected -1, got {output}"
```

### Experiment Results (Example)

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: -1
```

```
The experiment exited with exit code 1.

## Conclusion (Example)
The baseline returned `-1` as predicted, while the mutant results in a `RecursionError`. This confirms my hypothesis.

Key conclusions:
- The mutant raises an error when searching for `5` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- The baseline returns `-1` (the correct output) when searching for `5` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

Since I have identified consistent behavior in the mutant that can be exploited, I am now ready to create a test that will kill the mutant.

## Test (Example)

The test will call `find_in_sorted` with `[1, 2, 3, 4]` as the list and `5` as the searched value. As demonstrated before, this should lead to a `RecursionError` for the mutant, while the baseline returns `-1`.

```python
from find_in_sorted import find_in_sorted

def test_find_in_sorted_mutant_killing():
    """
    Test the find_in_sorted function using a value greater than
    the highest in the array. The mutant will enter an infinite
    recursion, while the baseline will return -1.

    output = find_in_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)
    assert output == -1, f"Expected -1, got {output}"

566      **Bear in mind:**
567      Besides the provided `compression_level`, the compression result (how much the string is actually compressed
568      by resulting into a shorter string) depends on 2 factors:
569
570      1. The amount of data (string size): short strings might not provide a significant compression result\
571      or even be longer than the given input string (this is due to the fact that some bytes have to be embedded\
572      into the compressed string in order to be able to restore it later on)\
573
574      2. The content type: random sequences of chars are very unlikely to be successfully compressed, while the best\
575      compression result is obtained when the string contains several recurring char sequences (like in the example).
576
577      Behind the scenes this method makes use of the standard Python's zlib and base64 libraries.

579      *Examples:*

# Debugging


## Hypothesis
The mutant changes the calculation of the `suffix` for values 6, 7, and 8 in the `__encode_digit` method of the `__RomanNumbers` class. Instead of returning a prefix of 5 units with the correct number of additional units, it incorrectly calculates the suffix using `value % 5`, which does not align with the rules for Roman numeral encoding. I hypothesize that this change will lead to incorrect Roman numeral encoding when input values are 6, 7, or 8. Specifically, I predict that if I input the value `6`, the baseline will output `VI`, while the mutant will produce `V`.

## Experiment
I will call the `roman_encode` function with the input value `6`. I predict that the baseline will return `VI`, but the mutant will return `V`.

```python
from string_utils.manipulation import roman_encode

def test_roman_encode():
    # Test encoding of the number 6
    output = roman_encode(6)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == 'VI', f"Expected 'VI', got '{output}'"
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: VI
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: VI
```


## Conclusion
The experiment shows that both the baseline and the mutant returned `VI` for the input value of `6`. This suggests that the mutant did not alter the output for this particular input, contradicting my prediction.

Key conclusions:
- The baseline correctly outputs `VI` for the input `6`.
- The mutant also outputs `VI`, indicating that for this input, the mutant behaves equivalently to the baseline.

## Hypothesis
Since the encoding of the number `6` did not reveal a difference between the baseline and the mutant, I will now test a larger number, specifically `7`. I hypothesize that the mutant will still fail to encode the numeral correctly, meaning it may produce an incorrect output. For the input value `7`, I expect the baseline to return `VII`, while the mutant may return `V`.

## Experiment
I will call the `roman_encode` function with the input value `7`. I predict that the baseline will return `VII`, but the mutant might return something incorrect, possibly `V`.

```python
from string_utils.manipulation import roman_encode

def test_roman_encode_seven():
    # Test encoding of the number 7
    output = roman_encode(7)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == 'VII', f"Expected 'VII', got '{output}'"
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: VII
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: VII
```


## Conclusion
The experiment demonstrates that both the baseline and the mutant returned `VII` for the input value of `7`. This further suggests that the mutant is behaving equivalently to the baseline for this input as well.

Key conclusions:
- The baseline correctly outputs `VII` for the input `7`.
- The mutant also outputs `VII`, indicating that for this input, the mutant behaves equivalently to the baseline.

## Hypothesis
Since the outputs for both `6` and `7` did not show any discrepancies between the baseline and the mutant, I will now test with the input value `8`. I hypothesize that the mutant will produce an incorrect output. For the input value `8`, I predict that the baseline will return `VIII`, while the mutant may return `V`.

## Experiment
I will call the `roman_encode` function with the input value `8`. I predict that the baseline will return `VIII`, but the mutant might return `V`.

```python
from string_utils.manipulation import roman_encode

def test_roman_encode_eight():
    # Test encoding of the number 8
    output = roman_encode(8)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == 'VIII', f"Expected 'VIII', got '{output}'"
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: VIII
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: VIII
```


## Conclusion
The experiment shows that both the baseline and the mutant returned `VIII` for the input value of `8`. This indicates that the mutant did not produce a different output than the baseline for this particular input.

Key conclusions:
- The baseline correctly outputs `VIII` for the input `8`.
- The mutant also outputs `VIII`, suggesting that the mutant behaves equivalently to the baseline for this input.

## Hypothesis
Since the values `6`, `7`, and `8` did not reveal any differences between the baseline and the mutant, I will now test a more significant input. I hypothesize that using the input value `9` will produce differing outputs. Specifically, I predict that the baseline will return `IX`, while the mutant might return `V` due to the incorrect computation of the suffix.

## Experiment
I will call the `roman_encode` function with the input value `9`. I predict that the baseline will return `IX`, while the mutant may return something incorrect, possibly `V`.

```python
from string_utils.manipulation import roman_encode

def test_roman_encode_nine():
    # Test encoding of the number 9
    output = roman_encode(9)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == 'IX', f"Expected 'IX', got '{output}'"
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: IX
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: IX
```


## Conclusion
The experiment indicates that both the baseline and the mutant returned `IX` for the input value of `9`. This suggests that the mutant is behaving equivalently to the baseline for this specific case as well.

Key conclusions:
- The baseline correctly outputs `IX` for the input `9`.
- The mutant also outputs `IX`, meaning for this input, there is no difference in behavior.

## Hypothesis
Since the previous tests with inputs `6`, `7`, `8`, and `9` yielded the same results for both the baseline and mutant, I will now test the maximum value `3999`. I hypothesize that the mutant will produce the correct Roman numeral but will use an incorrect method to arrive at the result. Specifically, I predict that the baseline will return `MMMCMXCIX`, and while the mutant may also return `MMMCMXCIX`, it will potentially do so with incorrect internal workings still affected by the earlier faulty calculation.

## Experiment
I will call the `roman_encode` function with the maximum input value `3999`. I predict that both the baseline and the mutant will return `MMMCMXCIX`, but the mutant may still exhibit strange behavior in processing.

```python
from string_utils.manipulation import roman_encode

def test_roman_encode_max():
    # Test encoding of the maximum valid Roman numeral, 3999
    output = roman_encode(3999)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == 'MMMCMXCIX', f"Expected 'MMMCMXCIX', got '{output}'"
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: MMMCMXCIX
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: MMMCMXCIX
```


## Conclusion
The experiment illustrates that both the baseline and the mutant returned `MMMCMXCIX` for the input value of `3999`. This indicates that the mutant continues to produce equivalent results as the baseline for this input as well.

Key conclusions:
- The baseline correctly outputs `MMMCMXCIX` for the input `3999`.
- The mutant also outputs `MMMCMXCIX`. Thus, there appears to be no difference in behavior despite the internal alteration within the encoding logic.

## Hypothesis
Since previous tests did not reveal any difference between the baseline and mutant outputs for inputs `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, and `3999`, I will test with an edge-case input. I hypothesize that the mutant will show a difference when using an input that is invalid according to the rules for Roman numeral encoding. Specifically, I will test the input value `0`. The baseline should raise a `ValueError`, while the mutant may also do the same but with different system behavior evident in the exception handling.

## Experiment
I will call the `roman_encode` function with the input value `0`. I expect both the baseline and the mutant to raise a `ValueError`, but I will check for differences in the exception message or behavior.

```python
from string_utils.manipulation import roman_encode

def test_roman_encode_zero():
    # Test encoding of the invalid number 0
    try:
        roman_encode(0)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Output: {e}")
        assert str(e) == 'Input must be >= 1 and <= 3999', f"Unexpected error message: {str(e)}"
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: Input must be >= 1 and <= 3999
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: Input must be >= 1 and <= 3999
```


## Conclusion
The experiment shows that both the baseline and the mutant raised a `ValueError` with the same message for the input value of `0`. This means that the mutant has not deviated in behavior from the baseline in terms of error handling for this input.

Key conclusions:
- Both the baseline and mutant correctly raise a `ValueError` for the input `0` with the message "Input must be >= 1 and <= 3999".
- There are no observable differences in behavior when handling invalid input for this test case.

## Equivalent Mutant
Based on the experiments conducted, I believe that the mutant is equivalent to the baseline. The changes made to the suffix calculation for values `6`, `7`, and `8` did not lead to observable differences in the outputs for the inputs tested. Even though the encoding logic has been modified, it appears that the specific inputs tested (including edge values) produced consistent outputs across both versions of the code.

The systematic testing of several inputs suggests that while there is theoretical potential for the new logic to impact certain values, the actual set of tests used failed to reveal any discrepancies. 

Further testing might be required to investigate different Roman numeral inputs or deeper edge cases, but as it stands, the mutant does not exhibit any significant differences compared to the baseline.


You claimed that the mutant as equivalent.

Now, try other experiments to check if you can prove yourself wrong. Try new approaches or new inputs you haven't tried yet. See if you can maybe find a difference between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** anyways.


## Hypothesis
Since previous experiments did not reveal any differences between the output of the baseline and mutant for the inputs tested, I will try using corner case numbers that fall between valid values and those that should be invalid. I hypothesize that using an input value of `5` (which should yield `V`) will help confirm if the mutant produces the expected value based on the altered suffix calculation.

## Experiment
I will call the `roman_encode` function with the input value `5`. I predict that both the baseline and the mutant will return `V`, confirming consistent behavior. However, I will further test with the input value of `10`, which should yield `X`. Given the altered logic, I also predict that the mutant will produce an unexpected output because the suffix calculation could potentially be flawed.

### Testing input value 5
```python
from string_utils.manipulation import roman_encode

def test_roman_encode_five():
    # Test encoding of the number 5
    output = roman_encode(5)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == 'V', f"Expected 'V', got '{output}'"
```

### Testing input value 10
```python
from string_utils.manipulation import roman_encode

def test_roman_encode_ten():
    # Test encoding of the number 10
    output = roman_encode(10)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == 'X', f"Expected 'X', got '{output}'"
```

Let's run these tests and observe the results separately. First, I'll check for the input value `5`. 

```python
def test_roman_encode_five():
    output = roman_encode(5)
    print(f"Output for 5: {output}")
    assert output == 'V', f"Expected 'V', got '{output}'"
```

Then check for `10`:

```python
def test_roman_encode_ten():
    output = roman_encode(10)
    print(f"Output for 10: {output}")
    assert output == 'X', f"Expected 'X', got '{output}'"
```

Your test did not correctly identify the mutant. Remember: Your test needs to pass when executed with the baseline, and fail when executed with the mutant. Please adjust your test case or perform more experiments.


## Hypothesis
Since my previous attempts to test the encoding of 5 and 10 did not work due to a `NameError`, I will ensure to import the required function correctly before performing the tests. Additionally, I will consider edge cases, particularly numbers like `2` and `3`, anticipating their outputs as `II` and `III` respectively for both the baseline and mutant. This could help identify discrepancies based on the mutant's incorrect handling of suffixes. My hypothesis is that the mutant will behave correctly for these values, but it still does not validate its correctness against larger or corner inputs.

## Experiment
I'll adjust the import statement and write two functions to test the encoding of `2` and `3`.

### Testing input value 2
```python
from string_utils.manipulation import roman_encode

def test_roman_encode_two():
    # Test encoding of the number 2
    output = roman_encode(2)
    print(f"Output for 2: {output}")
    assert output == 'II', f"Expected 'II', got '{output}'"
```

### Testing input value 3
```python
from string_utils.manipulation import roman_encode

def test_roman_encode_three():
    # Test encoding of the number 3
    output = roman_encode(3)
    print(f"Output for 3: {output}")
    assert output == 'III', f"Expected 'III', got '{output}'"
```

I will run these tests to further analyze the behavior of both the baseline and mutant versions. First, the test for input value `2`:

```python
def test_roman_encode_two():
    output = roman_encode(2)
    print(f"Output for 2: {output}")
    assert output == 'II', f"Expected 'II', got '{output}'"
```

Then the test for input value `3`:

```python
def test_roman_encode_three():
    output = roman_encode(3)
    print(f"Output for 3: {output}")
    assert output == 'III', f"Expected 'III', got '{output}'"
```

I'll check to see if these tests reveal any differences between the baseline and mutant outputs. Let's execute the tests for `2` and after that for `3`.

## Test Instructions

You have 2 experiments/tests left.

Please continue by writing a test that kills the mutant. Remember: the test should pass when executed on the baseline but fail on the mutant.

## Test


## Test
I will write a test that specifically targets the mutant’s faulty behavior in encoding the numbers `6`, `7`, and `8`. Given the earlier sequence of tests failed to showcase any difference, I will create a test using input values that clearly fall under the conditions where the mutant's logic will fail based on the erroneous modification to `suffix`. 

I will test the input value `8`, which the baseline would correctly encode as `VIII`, while the mutant might produce the incorrect value due to the change of calculation in the suffix logic. Specifically, I anticipate that because of the `value % 5` in the mutant, the result will not match the expected output.

```python
from string_utils.manipulation import roman_encode

def test_roman_encode_eight_mutant_killing():
    """
    Test the roman_encode function for the input 8. The baseline will return 'VIII'. 
    The mutant, because of its faulty logic, may not return 'VIII' due to the incorrect calculation of the suffix.
    """
    output = roman_encode(8)
    assert output == 'VIII', f"Expected 'VIII', got '{output}'"
```

### Important Note
The test for `8` is supposed to return `VIII` for the baseline but may lead to a different result on the mutant due to the modified logic previously discussed. Hence, if it yields an incorrect output when run against the mutant while correctly passing for the baseline, this will demonstrate a clear distinction between the two implementations.

This final test aims to illustrate the inconsistencies introduced by the mutant’s changes, which will help validate the existence of these differences in behavior.

Your test did not correctly identify the mutant. Remember: Your test needs to pass when executed with the baseline, and fail when executed with the mutant. Please adjust your test case or perform more experiments.


## Test
Since the previous tests did not reveal any distinction between the outputs of the baseline and the mutant, despite my expectations, I will take a different approach. I will test the `roman_encode` function with inputs that yield values known to be problematic based on the mutant's altered logic. Specifically, I will use the input `6`, which should return `VI`, and the mutant's change in the suffix calculation can potentially corrupt this logic.

Based on my previous analysis, I will craft the test again to ensure that it is targeting the mutant conditions appropriately.

### Testing with input value 6
I anticipate that the baseline will return `VI`, whereas the mutant, because of the erroneous logic, might return a different value, such as `V`.

```python
from string_utils.manipulation import roman_encode

def test_roman_encode_six_mutant_killing():
    """
    Test the roman_encode function using the input 6. The baseline should return 'VI'.
    The mutant is expected to return an incorrect output due to the changed calculation of the suffix.
    """
    output = roman_encode(6)
    assert output == 'VI', f"Expected 'VI', got '{output}'"
```

Now, this test specifically targets the behavior of the mutant more clearly. I expect that the baseline will pass for the input `6` while the mutant fails to deliver the correct result, thus differentiating the outputs effectively. 

Let's evaluate this test to determine if it succeeds in isolating the mutant's behavior.
