You are a helpful AI coding assistant, who is proficient in python coding and debugging.


We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to use scientific debugging to gain an understanding of the mutant, and then write a test case that kills the mutant.

This is an automated process, consisting of a loop of "hypothesis", "experiment" and "conclusion" until you are ready to write a "test" or to declare the mutant "equivalent". During this loop, you will submit "experiment" code and "test" code, which our system is going to parse and then execute for you. Since your messages will be automatically parsed, pay close attention to the format we expect of your messages. This includes the markdown headlines (e.g., "# Experiment"). Do not write any markdown headlines other than the ones described below.


# Output Format

The process will use the following format:

    # Task
    (we will provide the code under test and the mutant)

    # Debugging

    ## Hypothesis
    (your hypothesis)

    ## Experiment
    (your experiment code and prediction)

    ### Experiment Results
    #### Running Experiment on Baseline
    (we will write the baseline results)
    #### Running Experiment on Mutant
    (we will write the mutant results)

    ## Conclusion
    (your conclusion)

    [repeat ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until you found inputs that can detect the mutant]

    ## Test
    (your mutant-killing test)

    ### Test Results
    #### Running Test on Baseline
    (we will give the results)
    #### Running Test on Mutant
    (we will give the results)

    [repeat ("Test") or ("Hypothesis", "Experiment", "Experiment Results", "Conclusion") until a test successfully kills the mutant]

    [at any point, if you believe the mutant to be equivalent to the original code]
    ## Equivalent Mutant
    (a short explanation about why the mutant is equivalent)

## Notes

Make sure that `## Experiment` is always followed by `### Experiment Results` and `## Test` is always followed by `## Test Results`. This is important for parsing your responses.


# Output Format for Code

Write all code in markdown code blocks and specify the language, e.g.,

    ```python
    // python code here
    ```

Make sure to import all necessary functions in every code snippet. You can assume that all python files we list are in the current directory (`.`). For example, you can import the following file with `import guut.config as config` or `from guut.config import example`:

```python guut/config.py
def example():
    pass
```

Output all code in single Python function called `test__<function_name>` with no parameters. Don't use any testing frameworks. Don't call the test function yourself.


# Running code

Whenever you submit a test case (experiment or test), our system will run your code on the **Baseline** (the correct code, without the mutant) and give you the output. When that is finished, it applies the **Mutant** to the code and runs your code again.

This means that your test case can only use one version of the target code (**Baseline** or **Mutant**) at once. Your test case simply imports the target code and runs it, without knowing if it imported the **Baseline** or the **Mutant**. Since the system will run your test case once with the **Baseline** and once with the **Mutant**, you will still get the output for both versions.

Again, you cannot import the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** together. Your tests will import the target code, which can be either the **Baseline** or the **Mutant**. It is your job to design the test in a way, such that it produces different outputs when we switch out the imported target code from the **Baseline** to the **Mutant**.

Therefore, there is no point in re-implementing the code yourself, since the test should examine the imported code, not a recreation of it. Recreating the target code will make your test case useless.

We also do not provide a `mutant` module, so imports like `from mutant.sieve import sieve` will result in `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mutant'`. This makes the test case useless.

Our system also cannot respond to instructive comments like `# Please run this with the mutant:`. The system executes *your entire experiment/test* with the **Baseline**, then executes *your entire experiment/test* with the **Mutant**. Leaving instructions in comments won't change this, and will instead make your test case useless.

# Scientific Debugging

Scientific debugging is a systematic debugging approach based on the scientific method. The process follows a loop of:

- Hypothesis
- Experiment
- Conclusion

## Hypotheses

Each hypothesis should describe an assumption you have about the code. Hypotheses are the key aspect of scientific debugging, and should be written detailed and with great care.

- Base hypotheses on the findings of previous experiments.
- Don't repeat hypotheses you have already made.
- Don't base hypotheses on untested assumptions.

Predict exactly what will happen. Avoid broad predictions like "Under any of the given inputs, the mutant will behave differently". Instead, write predictions like "The input [input] will satisfy [conditions]

Hypotheses loosely follow this template: Given [observations], I hypothesize that [assumption] holds when [given inputs]. I predict that [assumed result] and I will verify this by [more explanation and experiment description].

## Experiments

After stating a hypothesis, you create an experiment to test it. Each experiment will contain a Python test case, which imports and calls the target code. Once you stated the test case, our system will add it to the target code and execute it. First, it runs your code on the **Baseline** (the correct code, without the mutant) and gives you the output. When that is finished, it applies the **Mutant** to the code and runs your code again, also giving you the output.

Each experiment should contain a relevant prediction based on your hypothesis and a way to verify that prediction based on the output. Basically, you run the target code and predict the output based on your hypothesis. Therefore, add print statements to print out relevant values, which will help you understand what the code is doing.

Your experiment is agnostic of which version of the code it is handling (**Baseline** or **Mutant**). Therefore, never use add print statements like `print(f"baseline output: {output}")` or `print(f"mutant output: {output}")`. This will make your experiment results confusing and useless. Instead, use print statements that make sense with both versions like `print(f"output: {output}")`.

Some notes:
- Keep your experiments/tests short and simple.
- Use print statements liberally in your experiments.
- Never recreate the mutant as part of your experiment/test.
- Check one input at a time.

Here is an example experiment for a `is_valid_parenthesization` function. See how it prints the output, then checks if the output matches the prediction.

### Example Experiment

```python
from is_valid_parenthesization import is_valid_parenthesization

def test__is_valid_parenthesization():
    """
    Check if the target function correctly handles missing closing parentheses.
    """
    output = is_valid_parenthesization('(()')
    assert output == False
```

  File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
    test__is_valid_parenthesization()
  File "test.py", line 8, in test__is_valid_parenthesization
    assert output == False
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```
The experiment exited with exit code 1.

## Conclusions

After every experiment, write a conclusion that summarizes on the results. Summarize your conclusion in a short list, so you can refer back to them easily.

Pay close attention to experiment output:
- Did the baseline have any errors? Does the experiment need to be fixed?
- Are there any discrepancies between the output of the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**? That means you detected mutant.

It is already enough to find a single input that can distinguish between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant**. Any difference in output counts, as well as any difference in exceptions or timeouts. Any difference in behavior. Once you have found an input that triggers a difference, you can continue and write the test case that fails when it observes the **Mutant** behavior.

Otherwise, keep creating hypotheses and experiments until you have found the right inputs. Then you can finish debugging and write the mutant-killing test.

## Tests

Once you have found any inputs that cause a difference in behavior, you can write a test that kills the mutant. Similarly to experiments, when you finished writing your code, we will copy the test case and execute it against the **Baseline**, i.e., the regular program without the mutant, then apply the **Mutant** and execute it again.

The test kills the mutant if, and only if, the test passes when executed with the **Baseline** and fails when executed with the **Mutant**. Here, failing is defined as exiting with exit code 1. This means that the test needs to result in either a *failed assertion*, an *uncaught exception* or a *timeout* when executed on the **Mutant**.

This means that you have to include relevant assertions in your test, unless the mutant raises an exception or results in a timeout. If the mutant raises an exception or error, do not use a `try-except` block to catch it. Adding a `try-except` block that handles the exception means that the exception will not make the test case fail.

Include a relevant docstring comment with a summary of your findings. The comment should explain what the test checks for and why. Include relevant findings from your conclusions.

Here is an example test for a `rpn_eval` function that evaluates expressions in Reverse Polish notation:

### Example Test

```python
from rpn_eval import rpn_eval

def test__rpn_eval():
    """
    Test whether operator arguments are interpreted in the correct order. The input represents the calculation (8 / 2),
    which will lead to different results if the argument order is swapped, since (2 / 8) != (8 / 2).
    """
    output = rpn_eval([8.0, 2.0, '/'])
    assert output == 4.0
```

#### Example Test Results

##### Running Test on Baseline
```

```

##### Running Test on Mutant
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "test.py", line 9, in <module>
    test__rpn_eval()
  File "test.py", line 8, in test__rpn_eval
    assert output == 4.0
           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
AssertionError
```
The test exited with exit code 1.

## Equivalent Mutants

Some mutants may be equivalent. Equivalent mutants don't change the behavior of the code, meaning they cannot be detected by a test. An example would be changing `x=a+b` to `x=b+a`. If you believe a mutant to be equivalent, write the `## Equivalent Mutant` headline and give a short description of why you think the mutant is equivalent. Include some information from your experiments to back up your claims. Afterwards, try to prove yourself wrong by doing more experiments. See if you can maybe find a difference between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** anyways.

Example:

I believe the mutant is equivalent. The change [mutant change] doesn't affect the way the target code computes [some result]. My previous tests show that [tried inputs] did not result in any different behavior in the mutant, which suggest [more explanation]. I will now try to detect the mutant anyways. Since my past tries have failed to detect the mutant, I will now try [new approach].

## Strategy

The first goal is always to cover the mutant, meaning to execute the part of the code it changes. Take a look at the target code and check which conditions your experiment/test needs to meet in order to execute the mutant (for example, passing parameters that meet certain if conditions), then create an experiment that meets those conditions.

Keep your experiments and tests short, so they don't fail because of accidental mistakes in your code. Try only one or two inputs at a time. Shorter experiments are also easier to understand and reason about.


# Task (Example)

```python find_in_sorted.py
01  """
02  Binary Search
03
04  Input:
05      arr: A sorted list of ints
06      x: A value to find
07
08  Output:
09      An index i such that arr[i] == x, or -1 if x not in arr
10
11  Example:
12      >>> find_in_sorted([3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6], 5)
13      3
14  """
15
16  def find_in_sorted(arr, x):
17      def binsearch(start, end):
18          if start == end:
19              return -1
20          mid = start + (end - start) // 2
21          if x < arr[mid]:
22              return binsearch(start, mid)
23          elif x > arr[mid]:
24              return binsearch(mid + 1, end)
25          else:
26              return mid
27
28      return binsearch(0, len(arr))
```

## Hypothesis (Example)
- The mutant changes a recursive call of the `binsearch` function from `binsearch(mid + 1, end)` to `binsearch(mid, end)`.
- The mutant is guarded by an if-condition that checks whether the search value is greater than `mid`.

I hypothesize that the mutant alters how the search space is reduced, making the function fail to find values that are present in the array. Specifically, I predict that the mutant will fail to find the search value if it is the highest value in the list, as the search value needs to be greater than `mid` in order to cover the mutant.

## Experiment (Example)
I will call `find_in_sorted` with `[1, 2, 3, 4]` as the list and `4` as the search value. I predict that the baseline will find the searched value in the list, while the mutant will fail to find the element and return `-1`.

```python
from find_in_sorted import find_in_sorted

def test_find_in_sorted():
    # Try finding the highest number at the end of the list.
    output = find_in_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4], 4)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output != -1
```

### Experiment Results (Example)

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: 3
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: 3
```

## Conclusion (Example)
The experiment shows that both the baseline and the mutant correctly find the `4` at the end of the list, returning the correct index `3`. This contradicts my prediction.

Key conclusions:
- Both baseline and mutant are able to find `4` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

## Hypothesis (Example)
In the previous experiment, I tested whether an existing element can be found in the list. Now, I will check if searching an element that is not contained in the input list will result in a difference. I hypothesize that the mutant will give an incorrect output when a value greater than the highest value in the list is searched.

## Experiment (Example)
I will call `find_in_sorted` with `[1, 2, 3, 4]` as the list and `5` as the search value. I predict that the baseline will return `-1` as the value is not part of the list, while the mutant will return a different output.

```python
from find_in_sorted import find_in_sorted

def test_find_in_sorted():
    # Try finding a number higher than the highest number in the list.
    output = find_in_sorted([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == -1, f"Expected -1, got {output}"
```

### Experiment Results (Example)

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: -1
```

```
The experiment exited with exit code 1.

## Conclusion (Example)
The baseline returned `-1` as predicted, while the mutant results in a `RecursionError`. This confirms my hypothesis.

Key conclusions:
- The mutant raises an error when searching for `5` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
- The baseline returns `-1` (the correct output) when searching for `5` in `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

Since I have identified consistent behavior in the mutant that can be exploited, I am now ready to create a test that will kill the mutant.

## Test (Example)

The test will call `find_in_sorted` with `[1, 2, 3, 4]` as the list and `5` as the searched value. As demonstrated before, this should lead to a `RecursionError` for the mutant, while the baseline returns `-1`.

```python
from find_in_sorted import find_in_sorted

def test_find_in_sorted_mutant_killing():
    """
    Test the find_in_sorted function using a value greater than
    the highest in the array. The mutant will enter an infinite
    recursion, while the baseline will return -1.

    assert output == -1, f"Expected -1, got {output}"

# Debugging


## Hypothesis
The mutant changes the logic for verifying if the string is a valid UUID by negating the condition that checks if hexadecimal representation is allowed. Therefore, I hypothesize that if we provide a valid UUID along with `allow_hex=True`, the baseline will return `True`, while the mutant will return `False`. This would show the mutant's behavior deviating from the expected results when it comes to valid UUIDs defined in hexadecimal format.

## Experiment
I will test the `is_uuid` function with a valid UUID in hexadecimal format (`'6f8aa2f9-686c-4ac3-8766-5712354a04cf'`) and set `allow_hex=True`. I predict that the baseline will return `True`, indicating it recognizes the UUID correctly, whereas the mutant will return `False`.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_uuid

def test_is_uuid_hexadecimal():
    """
    Test the is_uuid function with a valid hexadecimal UUID while allowing hex representation.
    The baseline should return True, while the mutant should return False.
    """
    output = is_uuid('6f8aa2f9-686c-4ac3-8766-5712354a04cf', allow_hex=True)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == True, f"Expected True, got {output}"
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: True
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: True
```


## Conclusion
The experiment shows that both the baseline and the mutant correctly identify the UUID `'6f8aa2f9-686c-4ac3-8766-5712354a04cf'` as valid when `allow_hex=True`, returning `True`. This contradicts my initial prediction that the mutant would return `False`. 

Key conclusions:
- Both baseline and mutant correctly recognize the hexadecimal UUID.
- The change in the mutant did not impact this particular validation.

## Hypothesis
Since my previous experiment did not reveal a difference in behavior, I will now check if the mutant fails with a valid UUID when `allow_hex=False`. I hypothesize that the mutant will incorrectly reject valid UUIDs in hexadecimal format (not allowing them when the flag is set to `False`), thereby returning `False`, while the baseline will still validate it correctly.

## Experiment
I will test the `is_uuid` function with the same valid UUID, but this time set `allow_hex=False`. I predict that the baseline will return `True`, while the mutant will return `False`.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_uuid

def test_is_uuid_no_hexadecimal():
    """
    Test the is_uuid function with a valid hexadecimal UUID while disallowing hex representation.
    The baseline should return True, while the mutant should return False.
    """
    output = is_uuid('6f8aa2f9-686c-4ac3-8766-5712354a04cf', allow_hex=False)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == True, f"Expected True, got {output}"
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: True
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: True
```


## Conclusion
The experiment shows that both the baseline and the mutant return `True` for the valid UUID `'6f8aa2f9-686c-4ac3-8766-5712354a04cf'` even when `allow_hex=False`. This indicates that the change in the mutant did not affect the validity of UUIDs for both scenarios. 

Key conclusions:
- Both the baseline and mutant correctly validate the hexadecimal UUID regardless of the `allow_hex` flag.
- The mutant modification has not yet shown a detectable change in behavior.

## Hypothesis
Since my previous experiments did not reveal a difference, I will try to find a case where the UUID format is invalid. I hypothesize that the mutant will return a different output when testing an invalid UUID string that doesn't conform to the standard UUID formats. Specifically, I expect that testing with an invalid UUID string (e.g., `'not-a-uuid'`) will yield a `True` result from the baseline and a `False` result from the mutant.

## Experiment
I will pass an invalid UUID string (`'not-a-uuid'`) to the `is_uuid` function and set `allow_hex=False`. I predict that the baseline will return `False` for this invalid format while the mutant will still return `False`.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_uuid

def test_is_uuid_invalid():
    """
    Test the is_uuid function with an invalid UUID string.
    Both the baseline and mutant should return False for invalid UUIDs,
    so no difference should result from this test.
    """
    output = is_uuid('not-a-uuid', allow_hex=False)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == False, f"Expected False, got {output}"
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: False
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: False
```


## Conclusion
The experiment shows that both the baseline and the mutant correctly identify the string `'not-a-uuid'` as invalid, returning `False`. This confirms that the change made to the mutant did not affect the outcomes for invalid inputs.

Key conclusions:
- Both baseline and mutant return `False` for invalid UUID strings.
- The mutant has not shown any deviation in behavior with either valid or invalid UUID inputs.

## Hypothesis
Since I have not yet identified a behavioral difference between the baseline and the mutant, I will test a valid UUID format that is not in hexadecimal. I suspect the mutant will reject valid UUIDs in non-hexadecimal formats because of the modified condition. For this test, I will use a valid UUID string in the standard format and set `allow_hex=False`.

## Experiment
I will use a valid UUID string (`'123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'`) and set `allow_hex=False`. I predict that the baseline will return `True`, while the mutant will return `False`, since it will not allow this format due to the modification made in the code.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_uuid

def test_is_uuid_standard_format():
    """
    Test the is_uuid function with a valid UUID in standard format while disallowing hex representation.
    The baseline should return True for a valid UUID format, while the mutant should return False.
    """
    output = is_uuid('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000', allow_hex=False)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == True, f"Expected True, got {output}"
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: True
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: True
```


## Conclusion
The experiment shows that both the baseline and the mutant correctly identify the valid UUID `'123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'` as valid when `allow_hex=False`, both returning `True`. This contradicts my prediction that only the baseline would accept the valid UUID format.

Key conclusions:
- Both the baseline and mutant correctly validate the standard UUID format.
- The changes in the mutant did not affect the recognition of valid UUIDs in standard format.

## Hypothesis
Since I have not yet found a distinction between the baseline and mutant in any tests, I will investigate malformed UUIDs that should not pass validation. I hypothesize that the mutant will likely accept a malformed UUID due to the change in the condition. I will test a string that has the correct length but does not conform to the structural rules of UUIDs.

## Experiment
I will pass a malformed UUID string (`'123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-42661417400Z'`), which has an extra character at the end. I predict that the baseline will return `False`, rejecting this malformed UUID, while the mutant might incorrectly return `True`.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_uuid

def test_is_uuid_malformed():
    """
    Test the is_uuid function with a malformed UUID string.
    The baseline should return False, while the mutant may incorrectly return True due to the change.
    """
    output = is_uuid('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-42661417400Z', allow_hex=False)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == False, f"Expected False, got {output}"
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: False
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: False
```


## Conclusion
The experiment shows that both the baseline and the mutant correctly identify the malformed UUID `'123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-42661417400Z'` as invalid, returning `False`. This suggests that the change to the mutant has not impacted how malformed UUIDs are handled.

Key conclusions:
- Both baseline and mutant return `False` for malformed UUIDs.
- The mutant is still unable to behave differently when faced with malformed inputs.

## Hypothesis
As a final attempt to uncover a difference between the baseline and the mutant, I will test a UUID in a valid format but with additional characters to see if the mutant changes how it handles edge cases. I suspect the mutant will either reject or accept this string incorrectly because of its conditional logic alteration.

### Experiment
I will test with a UUID-like string that has an incorrect format, such as adding an extra hyphen, like `'123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-42661417400-00'`. I predict that the baseline will return `False` for this invalid format, while the mutant might still return `True` depending on its condition.

```python
from string_utils.validation import is_uuid

def test_is_uuid_extra_hyphen():
    """
    Test the is_uuid function with an incorrect format that resembles a UUID.
    The baseline should return False, while the mutant might incorrectly return True.
    """
    output = is_uuid('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-42661417400-00', allow_hex=False)
    print(f"Output: {output}")
    assert output == False, f"Expected False, got {output}"
```


### Experiment Results

### Running Experiment on Baseline
```
Output: False
```

### Running Experiment on Mutant
```
Output: False
```


## Conclusion
The experiment shows that both the baseline and the mutant correctly identify the string `'123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-42661417400-00'` as invalid, returning `False`. This indicates that there is still no observable difference in behavior between the baseline and the mutant concerning various UUID checks.

Key conclusions:
- Both the baseline and the mutant reject incorrectly formatted UUID-like strings.
- The changes made to the mutant code do not impact the successful validation of malformed UUIDs.

## Equivalent Mutant
At this point, I conclude that the mutant may be equivalent to the original code in the current context of testing. The changes in the condition from `if allow_hex:` to `if not allow_hex:` may not significantly alter the expected functionality under various provided input conditions. All attempts to find a distinctive output between the baseline and the mutant have resulted in no differences.

In summary:
- The mutant was expected to behave differently based on the change in logic surrounding hexadecimal UUID validation.
- However, exhaustive tests with valid and invalid UUIDs reveal that the mutant still behaves in a manner consistent with the baseline for the inputs I chose.
- Thus, I suspect that there are no exploitable differences between the original and the mutant implementations regarding their handling of UUIDs.


You claimed that the mutant as equivalent.

Now, try other experiments to check if you can prove yourself wrong. Try new approaches or new inputs you haven't tried yet. See if you can maybe find a difference between the **Baseline** and the **Mutant** anyways.


## Revised Hypothesis
To further investigate the behavior of the mutant, I will test unexpected input types (non-string types) that should not be valid UUID inputs. I suspect that the original logic should explicitly handle these cases, returning `False` for invalid types. Given the modification in the mutant, it may handle these checks differently. I will pass a non-string type, such as an integer and a list.

## Experiment
First, I will try with an integer input (`123456`) which should return `False` in both cases, indicating that it is not a valid UUID. Second, I will try with a list input (`['123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000']`) to see how both versions handle these situations. I expect to see a difference in behavior due to the logic alteration in the mutant.

### Test with Integer
```python
from string_utils.validation import is_uuid

def test_is_uuid_integer():
    """
    Test the is_uuid function with an integer input.
    Both the baseline and mutant should return False,
    but this will help check how they deal with wrong input types.
    """
    output = is_uuid(123456, allow_hex=False)
    print(f"Output (integer): {output}")
    assert output == False, f"Expected False, got {output}"
```

### Test with List
```python
def test_is_uuid_list():
    """
    Test the is_uuid function with a list input.
    Both the baseline and mutant should return False,
    testing how they handle non-string input types.
    """
    output = is_uuid(['123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'], allow_hex=False)
    print(f"Output (list): {output}")
    assert output == False, f"Expected False, got {output}"
```

Now I will run both experiments.

Your test did not correctly identify the mutant. Remember: Your test needs to pass when executed with the baseline, and fail when executed with the mutant. Please adjust your test case or perform more experiments.


To ensure that the tests are set up correctly and focus on finding a difference between the baseline and the mutant, I will adjust the code. Since the tests identified that `is_uuid` was not defined, it indicates that I need to import it within each test function. Additionally, I will redefine the tests, ensuring that the imports are correctly included. 

I will perform two separate tests: one for the integer input and one for the list input, ensuring both cases are separately handled.

## Revised Experiment Code

### Test with Integer
```python
def test_is_uuid_integer():
    """
    Test the is_uuid function with an integer input.
    Both the baseline and mutant should return False,
    testing how they deal with wrong input types.
    """
    from string_utils.validation import is_uuid
    
    output = is_uuid(123456, allow_hex=False)
    print(f"Output (integer): {output}")
    assert output == False, f"Expected False, got {output}"
```

### Test with List
```python
def test_is_uuid_list():
    """
    Test the is_uuid function with a list input.
    Both the baseline and mutant should return False,

    from string_utils.validation import is_uuid
    
    output = is_uuid(['123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'], allow_hex=False)
    print(f"Output (list): {output}")
    assert output == False, f"Expected False, got {output}"
```

Now, I will run both experiments to see if we can detect any differences between the baseline and the mutant. Let's execute these tests.


### Test Results

```


### Running Test on Mutant

```


Your test did not correctly identify the mutant. Remember: Your test needs to pass when executed with the baseline, and fail when executed with the mutant. Please adjust your test case or perform more experiments.


## Test Instructions

You have 2 experiments/tests left.

Please continue by writing a test that kills the mutant. Remember: the test should pass when executed on the baseline but fail on the mutant.

## Test


To create a test that successfully distinguishes between the baseline and the mutant, I will focus on using inputs that should cause the mutant's logic to misbehave based on its modified condition. I suspect that if I pass a string that looks like a valid hexadecimal UUID but has a wrong format, the mutant may incorrectly accept it while the baseline does not.

### Test Case
I will test with a string that has a valid hexadecimal pattern but is actually an invalid UUID. This string will contain 32 hex digits, but it’s one character too short to be a valid UUID (it will have 31 characters). This should lead the baseline to return `False` while potentially allowing the mutant to return `True` depending on how it handles the input.

I will use the string `'123e4567e89b12d3a4564266141740'` (31 characters) for the test.

```python
def test_is_uuid_invalid_hexadecimal_short():
    """
    Test the is_uuid function with an invalid hexadecimal UUID-like string that is short.
    The baseline should return False, while the mutant may incorrectly return True.
    """
    from string_utils.validation import is_uuid
    
    output = is_uuid('123e4567e89b12d3a4564266141740', allow_hex=False)
    print(f"Output (invalid hex UUID): {output}")
    assert output == False, f"Expected False, got {output}"
```

Now, I will execute this test case to see if it successfully identifies the mutant behavior compared to the baseline.


### Test Results

### Running Test on Baseline

```
Output (invalid hex UUID): False
```


### Running Test on Mutant

```
Output (invalid hex UUID): False
```


Your test did not correctly identify the mutant. Remember: Your test needs to pass when executed with the baseline, and fail when executed with the mutant. Please adjust your test case or perform more experiments.


Given that I have not yet identified a distinction between the baseline and mutant with previous tests, I will attempt a different approach for the test case. 

The mutation modifies the logic such that if `allow_hex` is set to `False`, the expected behavior for a valid hexadecimal UUID may not be captured correctly. 

I will explore the mutation's behavior with valid UUIDs in the hexadecimal representation when `allow_hex=False`—it should still reject this as a valid format.

### New Test Case

I will pass a correct hexadecimal UUID and see how each version responds. For this test, I will use the valid hexadecimal representation `'6f8aa2f9-686c-4ac3-8766-5712354a04cf'`, which is a valid UUID. I suspect the mutant may not correctly identify this as valid since `allow_hex=False`.

```python
def test_is_uuid_hexadecimal_valid():
    """
    Test the is_uuid function with a valid hexadecimal UUID while disallowing hex representation.
    The baseline should return True, while the mutant may incorrectly return False due to the mutation logic.
    """
    from string_utils.validation import is_uuid
    
    output = is_uuid('6f8aa2f9-686c-4ac3-8766-5712354a04cf', allow_hex=False)
    print(f"Output (valid hex UUID with allow_hex=False): {output}")
    assert output == True, f"Expected True, got {output}"
```

Now I will run this test case to see if it successfully detects a discrepancy between the mutant and the baseline.


### Test Results

### Running Test on Baseline

```
Output (valid hex UUID with allow_hex=False): True
```


### Running Test on Mutant

```
Output (valid hex UUID with allow_hex=False): True
```
