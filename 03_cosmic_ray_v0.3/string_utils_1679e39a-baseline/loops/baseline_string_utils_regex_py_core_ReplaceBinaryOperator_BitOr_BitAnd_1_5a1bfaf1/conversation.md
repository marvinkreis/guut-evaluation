You are a helpful AI coding assistant, who is proficient in python coding and debugging.


We are going to give you a Python program and a mutant diff. We want you to write a test case that detects the mutant. The test case should pass when executed with the correct code, but fail when executed with the mutant.

This is an automated process. Your messages will be automatically parsed by our system.

Write all code in markdown code blocks and specify the language, e.g.:

    ```python
    // python code here
    ```

Make sure to import all necessary functions in every code snippet. You can assume that all python files we list are in the current directory (`.`). For example, you can import the following file with `import guut.config as config` or `from guut.config import example`:

```python guut/config.py
def example():
    pass
```

Important remarks:

- Output the test as single Python function called `test__<function_name>` with no parameters.
- Don't use any testing frameworks.
- Test one input at a time. Don't create a test case that checks multiple inputs.
- Include a docstring comment describing what the test does and why it kills the mutant.

Example test:

```python
from rpn_eval import rpn_eval

def test__rpn_eval():
    """
    Test whether operator argumenets are interpreted in the correct order. The input represents the calculation (8 / 2),
    which will lead to different results if the argument order is swapped, since (2 / 8) != (8 / 2).
    """
    output = rpn_eval([8.0, 2.0, '/'])
    assert output == 4.0
```

Some mutants may be equivalent. Equivalent mutants don't change the behavior of the code, meaning they cannot be detected by a test. An example would be changing `x=a+b` to `x=b+a`. If you believe a mutant to be equivalent, write the `# Equivalent Mutant` headline and give a short description of why you think the mutant is equivalent. Include some information from your experiments to back up your claims. Afterwards, try to prove yourself wrong by trying to write a killing test anyways. See if you can maybe find a difference between the baseline and the mutant anyways.

Example:

# Equivalent Mutant (Example)

I believe the mutant is equivalent. The change [mutant change] doesn't affect the way [some result] is computed. My previous tests show that [tried inputs] did not result in any different behavior in the mutant, which suggest [more explanation]. I will now try to detect the mutant anyways. Since my past tries have failed to detect the mutant, I will now try [new approach].

    The input string includes varying whitespace and punctuation which should be counted as separate words.
    """
    test_string = "Count the words: hello, world, and all! 123."  # Expected words: ['Count', 'the', 'words', 'hello', 'world', 'and', 'all', '123']
    matches = WORDS_COUNT_RE.findall(test_string)
    assert len(matches) == 8  # The input string should match 8 words
```

This test is designed to ensure the regex's robustness in accurately counting the words in the provided input string. Including both punctuation and a variety of words will demonstrate the difference between the functioning of the original regex and the mutant's altered behavior.

Your test did not correctly identify the mutant. Remember: Your test needs to pass when executed with the baseline, and fail when executed with the mutant. Please adjust your test case.


```python
from string_utils._regex import WORDS_COUNT_RE

def test__WORDS_COUNT_RE():
    """
    Test to check that the WORDS_COUNT_RE regex correctly counts and retrieves words from a string with
    various punctuation marks and spacing. The input string includes commas, periods, and exclamation points,
    which are expected to be handled properly by the original regex. The mutant's alterations will cause it to fail
    since it incorrectly changes the operator between flags, preventing correct matching.
    """
    test_string = "Hello! How are you, today? This is a test."  # Expected words: ['Hello', 'How', 'are', 'you', 'today', 'This', 'is', 'a', 'test']
    matches = WORDS_COUNT_RE.findall(test_string)
    assert len(matches) == 9  # The input string should match 9 words
```

This test ensures the regex behaves properly on the baseline, dealing with punctuation correctly while being vulnerable on the mutant version due to the introduced logical error.
